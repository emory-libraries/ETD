CHANGE LOG
=================
Version 1.18.1
--------------
Updated Honors Program submission notification

Version 1.18: Creating records for students & BME dissertations
------------
NOTE the migration added in this release, 022, DOES NOT WORK. It is left in for documentation purposes.
In this release, a Rollins program was changed in the SKOS from `rsph-cmph` to `rsph-emph` and the label was changed to `Executive Masters of Public Health`. Migration 022 updates everything but the id on the collection. The changes to the SKOS were made manually. Sorry.

* ETD admins can create records on behalf of students and the permissions are set properly for the student to edit.
* PID creation was changed from using PIDMans soap api to the REST api.
* Text was added to explain where to find biomedical engineering dissertations.
* Reports can now be generated for every academic year that has ETDs.
* Bug fix for Laney reports. They are no longer paginated to just give 100 ETDs. A few more zeros were added.

Version 1.17.6
--------------
* It was determined that `fileinfo` is broken and now MimeTypes are determined using `/usr/local/bin/file`
* Updated file icon mappings for new MimeTypes being reported using the new MimeType finder. Later Office files no longer report as zips.

Version 1.17.5
--------------
* Added logging for seeing mimetype of uploaded file.

Version 1.17.4
--------------
* Bug fix for "Replace file functionality": PT# 103231518.

* The mimetype of the new file is checked against the mimetype stored in Fedora
* Added mimetype `vnd.ms-excel` to get the pre '07 Excel icon. `vnc.ms-excel` was the only one in the logic.

Version 1.17
------------

* Updated from SSL3 to SSL4 for curl

Features in this release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* An author can edit details for uploaded files in any modern browser, so that
  they don't have to worry about which browser they are using to submit their
  ETD record.
* An author can enter their thesis information (name, language, keywords &
  degree) in any modern browser, so that they don't have to worry about which
  browser they are using to submit their ETD record.
* When a student uploads a PDF to create a new ETD record, the advisor and
  committee members are not populated to avoid invalid and/or inaccurate
  information about advisors.
* When a student uploads a PDF to create a new ETD record, the abstract and
  TOC are not populated so that records are not created with incomplete or
  unusable text.
* When a student is viewing a draft submission without an abstract or TOC, a
  text prompt instructs the student to add them to the record.
* When a student goes through the submission process, he sees abstract and
  table of contents as steps in the Submission Status list so that the student
  knows those fields are required.
* A user can submit a help request via a web form with the same look and feel
  as other forms on the site, for consistency and maintainability.
* When a student is answering the initial submission screening questions, they
  see options side by side so that more of the form is visible on the page at one time.
* A student submitting an ETD has an option to change her pre-selected school
  before selecting her program to ensure that her thesis goes to the correct administrator.
* An admin viewing an approved record has an option to "revert to draft" so that
  students may make last-minute changes to a thesis.
* After a student answers the three submission screening questions, the student
  is prompted to enter their document title (instead of uploading a PDF) to begin
  the submission process.
* When a student is viewing a draft record, a student sees secondary (blue) edit
  links just after the corresponding field to be edited so that secondary edit links
  do not compete with submission status menu.
* When a user is viewing the submission status menu of an active/draft record they
  will see red 'X' or a green check mark next to every item on the list, so that the
  navigation is consistent, more intuitive, and leads them to complete the record.
* Any user viewing an ETD record can see the author's school and program, so that they
  can tell at a glance which Emory school the thesis or dissertation is associated with
  (and so an admin or author can correct the school, if necessary).
* When a student is viewing a draft record and submission edit form pages, they do not
  see search and browse links in the left side bar, so that they are less distracted
  by links unrelated to the submission process.
* When an anonymous user visits the ETD page, it is clear that he must login to submit
  and manage theses and dissertations--because information to the right of the login
  button tells him to do so.
* A logged in student sees a highlighted  "Submit your thesis" link so that he knows
  where to click to begin the thesis submission process.
* An author or administrator viewing a draft record can access status key and instructions
  when viewing the submission checklist, so that they can refer to the key and instructions
  when necessary.
* A student viewing his draft record page, sees a clear link to the instructions page of the
  ETD site that opens in a new window so that the student has access to the instructions
  for the submission process whenever he needs it during the submission process.
* A student viewing the add/edit file page sees clear instructions about adding / editing a
  file so that it is clear to a student reading the text that he must upload a minimum of
  two files of his thesis or dissertation, one of which will be a PDF and the other, most
  likely, a Word file.
* A student viewing the edit Committee/Adviser page sees instructions that direct
  students to use the boxes correctly.
* A student viewing the contact edit form will see the label "date valid for mailing address"
  instead of "date valid"  so that students know it refers to the date valid for their
  mailing address.
* A user of the site will see links for abstract and table of contents named and styled
  consistently with the other edit links on draft submission page so the page will have
  uniform look and feel.
* A student editing information on his draft record sees updated/more concise text so
  that he can use the site more effectively.
* A student beginning the submission process will see a consistently formatted list of
  screening questions so that they can easily see which questions are related and fill out all fields.
* An author starting a new submission will see updated screening question text so that
  they will have a better understanding of their responsibility in regard to copywrite laws,
  patented information and embargoing their submission.
