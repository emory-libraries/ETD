<h1>Processing PDF</h1>
    
<p>There was an error processing your PDF.</p>

<?= $this->render("submission/_processpdf_errs.phtml"); ?>

<p>Suggestions for resolving this problem:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Check to make sure that your PDF is not an "image-only" document. 
 The text of your PDF should be searchable in Adobe Reader.  If it is not, it
 may be an image-only document.</li>
 <li>Ensure that your document does not include images of signatures, your own 
 nor those of your committee members.</li>
 <li>The system cannot accept an encrypted PDF.</li>
 <li>All PDFs should be created using Adobe Acrobat Professional.  We cannot 
 guarantee that PDFs created with other tools will meet our requirements for
 long-term preservation.</li>
 <li>Check that all required pages are included in the correct order.  The correct 
 ordered is detailed in the submission instructions.</li>
</ul>
