Services in ETD
===============
- The about page for each service can be found by going to <base url>/services/<service name>.
  Example https://asbestos.library.emory.edu/services/Xmlbyid.
- The related files are located in the project here: src/app/modules/services
- Alternate_hosts and Alternate_ports can be configured so that the service will
  accept connections from other fedora instances besides the instance it is configured to communicate with.
- The development and staging instances should always be configured to point to the staging version unless
  development is being done on the service.  If development is being don on the service it should be configured
  to point to the developer's instance of the service.
- The instance of the service can be configured by editing the location url in the WSDL datastream in the related Fedora object.


Xmlbyid: This php web service retrieves an xml datastream from Fedora and then gives the user just one part of it, according to the specified id.
         - Some valid id's are 'title' and 'abstract'.
         - The related Fedora object is emory-control:ETDmetadataParts.
