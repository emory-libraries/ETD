Myocardial Ischemia after Acute Myocardial Infarction","Objectives. Depression is an adverse prognostic factor after an
acute myocardial infarction (MI), and an increased propensity
toward emotionally-driven myocardial ischemia may play a role. We
aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and
mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia in young survivors of an
MI.
Methods. We studied 98 patients (49 women and 49 men) age 38-60
years who were hospitalized for acute MI in the previous 6 months.
Patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, after
mental stress (speech task), and after exercise or pharmacological
stress. A summed difference score (SDS), obtained through
observer-independent software, was used to quantify myocardial
ischemia under both stress conditions. The Beck Depression
Inventory-II (BDI-II) was used to measure depressive symptoms,
which were analyzed as overall score, and as separate somatic and
cognitive depressive symptom scores.
Results. There was a significant positive association between
depressive symptoms and SDS with mental stress, denoting more
ischemia. After adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors,
disease severity and medications, each incremental depressive
symptom was associated with 0.14 points higher SDS. When somatic
and cognitive depressive symptoms were examined separately, both
somatic [ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â²=0.17,
95% CI: (0.04, 0.30), p=0.01] and cognitive symptoms
[ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â²=0.31, 95% CI:
(0.07, 0.56), p=0.01] were significantly associated with mental
stress-induced ischemia. Depressive symptoms were not associated
with ischemia induced by exercise or pharmacological stress.
Conclusion. Among young post-MI patients, higher levels of both
cognitive and somatic depressive symptoms are associated with a
higher propensity to develop myocardial ischemia with mental
stress, but not with exercise/pharmacological stress.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I: Background. 1 -- Chapter II:

Material Girls and Imperial Fashions:
The Circulation of Ideologies and Commerce in the Hispanic
Enlightenment
In my dissertation I examine how and to what extent women's
material culture functions in debates on utility and morality in
encyclopedic texts from Spain and Spanish America. By ""encyclopedic
text"" I am referring to works that follow certain parameters: a
trend of collecting, organizing, and disseminating a broad
knowledge base with explicit or implicit didactic aims.
Encyclopedias are gold mines for political jabs and heated debates
that were grounded in particular socio-economic
circumstances.
The debate regarding women and material fashions is a
far-reaching argument but the encyclopedia entries and histories I
analyze are specifically located geographically. The scope of my
project is trans-Atlantic and I employ this approach to uncover the
ways in which the polemic on women's material culture is
articulated in a Hispanic global eighteenth century.
The primary text that serves as the backbone of my project is
the Encyclopedia Metódica which was published in Spain
by a successful publisher named Antonio de Sancha from 1788-1794.
Other texts I discuss in the dissertation are the Viaje a la
América Meridional by Spaniards Jorge Juan and Antonio de
Ulloa, the Rusticatio Mexicana by creole Jesuit Rafael
Landívar, the Teatro critico universal by Benito
Jerónimo Feijoo, and the Historia de la Villa Imperial de
Potosí by the chronicler Bartolomé Arzáns.
I suggest that the authors I focus on use the material figure
of women as a kind of measurement to prove or criticize the
advancement of reason in particular geographic areas. Women were
represented as inherently connected to materiality and because of
this they were bound to socio-economic critiques that described
them as both necessary for economic development and as potentially
harmful with the potential to disrupt social and moral order
through excess luxuries and seductive fashions.
Through analyzing the representation of women's
materiality in rationalist discourse I am able to illustrate a
fraught connection between material and intellectual production
that enriches our understanding of the Hispanic eighteenth
century.","Table of Contents -- Introduction -- Chapter 1 -- Material

the SFE Survey and its Related Products","Background: Students pursuing a Master of Public Health degree
at Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH) often complete a summer
field experience (SFE) between the first and second years of their
respective programs. In order to track, evaluate and improve the
quality of SFEs, the Summer Field Experience Survey was created in
2004. Efforts related to the 2012 SFE Survey indicated a need to
standardize SFE Survey processes.
Methods: A mixed method design was used in the study. The
project was conducted between May and August of 2013. Three
components were included in the mixed-methods design: (1) a
comprehensive literature review of the past 9 years of SFE reports;
(2) an online survey of 49 potential end-user preferences grouped
into 10 initial categories; and (3) one focus group session on
end-user preferences.
Analysis: Literature review helped identify potential end-users
and indicated that annual SFE Survey methods varied slightly. The
online survey respondents and the focus group reported that survey
content had been useful. Most end-users preferred a summary report
with some discussion, analysis and interpretation. They preferred
to disseminate the report before the Practicum Opportunities Fair,
which is held around the first week of November. Specific content
desired by end-users varied by group (i.e. student, faculty, IRB,
etc.)
Discussion: Information obtained through the literature review
indicated a potential need for some standardization of processes
related to the SFE Survey. The online survey and focus group helped
inform the creation of revised SFE Surveys, a new template for the
SFE Full Report, and comprehensive standard operating procedures
(SOP) for conducting, analyzing, disseminating, and evaluating the
SFE Survey and its related products. The SFE SOP includes the SFE
Full Report and a new system of targeted reports based on content,
timing and format preferences of end users.
Future Recommendations: Additional recommendations not included
in the revised surveys, full report template or SOP, but gathered
from feedback arising from the online survey and/or focus group,
include making the SFE Survey a requirement for spring
registration, a pre-departure survey, and SFE data availability
through an open-sources data management tool for independent
queries and analysis.","Table of Contents -- Background
