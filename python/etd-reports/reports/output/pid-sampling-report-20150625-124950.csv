Selling to the Souls of Black Folk:
Atlanta, Reverend J.M. Gates, the Phonograph, and the
Transformation of African
American Protestantism and Culture, 1910-1945 .
By Lerone A. Martin
There is much work in the discipline of American religious history
that chronicles
the significance of mass mediums such as print, radio, film,
television, and the Internet in
the practice(s) of Protestant Christianity. However, the field has
been slow to recognize
the phonograph as an equally vital tool within these traditions.
Selling to the Souls of
Black Folk takes up this neglected task by historically
tracing the phenomenon of African
American Protestant clergy utilizing the phonograph for the mass
transmission of their
sermons during the first half of the Twentieth century. This
unprecedented use of mass
communication and religious commodification enabled black clergy,
who were largely
marginalized from radio, to become cultural celebrities, alongside
popular music artists,
within African American communities. Leading record labels recorded
these spiritual
commodities and advertised them in black newspapers, posters,
handbills, department
stores, mail-order catalogues, record label shops, and furniture
stores. As a result, the
placement of these sermons on the market shelf significantly
altered the substance and
form of black religious practices. This story examines several of
the approximately one
hundred African American phonograph sermon recorders prior to World
War II.
However, Atlanta and the city's Reverend J.M. Gates, the most
prolific phonograph
sermon recorder, are the anchors of this historical study. This
conceptual lynchpin allows
for a concentrated analysis of how the emergence and popularity of
phonograph sermons
both reflected and facilitated shifts within African American
Protestantism. Selling to the
Souls of Black Folk, therefore, offers an important
historical account that is essential to
understanding the major trends and practices that undergird
contemporary American
Protestantism and religious broadcasting.

from the Zebrafish (Danio Rerio): Comparisons with Human
Monoamine Oxidases A and B
","Monoamine Oxidases (MAO) are flavin containing enzymes located
in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mammals, including humans are
shown to contain two forms of this enzyme as MAO A and MAO B.
However, not all organisms contain two separate genes expressing
these enzymes. Recent studies have shown that zebrafish, a popular
teleost organism suitable for various pharmacological applications,
contains a single MAO gene. It was proposed that human and teleost
MAOs are co-orthologs and share a single common ancestor that
underwent a gene duplication event. In addition, studies with whole
zebrafish neural tissues have shown that zebrafish MAO exhibit
properties closer to human MAO A. To test this hypothesis and to
provide the first detailed characterization of zebrafish MAO
(zMAO), we developed a high-level expression and purification
system for zMAO where we could obtain 235 mg of protein from 0.5 L
culture of Pichia pastoris. Then we performed the first
detailed functional analysis of the protein with various MAO A and
MAO B specific substrates and inhibitors. Here, we also present a
comprehensive analysis of quantitive structure relationship of zMAO
catalysis in comparison with the human MAO isoforms. Overall data
suggest that zMAO contains the properties of both human MAO A and
MAO B with properties closer to those of MAO A. The studies from
this dissertation provide extensive analysis of this single form of
the enzyme and are aimed to be helpful in the pharmacological
studies that target designing better drugs targeting MAO using this
zebrafish as a system.","Table of Contents -- CHAPTER 1 - Introduction to Monoamine Oxidases

Life and Love in Chaucer's Dream Vision Poetry","In the decades preceding his magnum opus, The Canterbury
Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer experimented with different forms of
poetry while serving as a diplomat in the court of Edward III.
Between 1368 and 1381, Chaucer wrote three poems in the style of
the medieval dream vision: Book of the Duchess, House of
Fame, and Parliament of Fowls. In each of the three
poems, the dreamer comes from a place of anxiety concerning love.
The dreamer then encounters a story from a well-known Roman author,
which provokes subconscious meditation on love when the dreamer
falls asleep. In this thesis, I connect the structural parallels
existing between the poems to courtly and classical traditions,
with the courtly perspective of fin amors reflecting
""earthly love"" (or corporeal love) and the classical perspectives
of Stoicism and Neoplatonism reflecting ""spiritual love"" (or
incorporeal love). The dichotomy that emerges between corporeal
desire and incorporeal inclination appears irreconcilable in all
three of the poems. However, upon analyzing the bathetic endings of
the poems, only Parliament of Fowls approaches a remedy for
confronting the mysterious realm of love. As such, I argue that
Parliament of Fowls rests as the consummation of Chaucer's toils
with love-based anxiety in Book of the Duchess and House
of Fame, both of which preceded Parliament of Fowls in
their dates of completion. Ultimately, I show how Chaucer expresses
the futility of subscribing to established traditions and
philosophies when seeking guidance in the ""maze"" of varying
opinions on conduct in love.","Table of Contents --

Effects of Stable Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor Knockdown
on Triple-Negative Breast
Cancer Cells
By Elaine Oberlick
Next to non-melanomatous skin cancer, breast cancer is the most
common cancer diagnosed among American women today. It is estimated
that yearly, more than 190,000 women
are diagnosed with breast cancer and greater than 40,000 succumb to
the disease. Aggressive, metastatic disease is directly responsible
for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths. Triple-negative
(TN) breast cancers, which lack estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor and HER2/neu overexpression, lead to poorer survival
outcomes compared to all other breast cancer patients, partly
because of a lack of therapeutic targets. Insulin-like growth
factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is overexpressed in 50% of primary
breast tumors compared with normal tissues and 36% of TN breast
cancers express IGF-1R. IGF-1R plays a role in proliferation,
apoptosis, adhesion, and invasion, suggesting that breast cancers
have enhanced responses to the mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects
of IGF-I. The objective of this project was to determine the
significance of differential IGF-1R signaling in the aggressive
properties of TN breast tumors. Stable lentiviral IGF-1R knockdown
was performed in two morphologically distinct TN breast cancer cell
lines, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231. Knockdown of IGF-1R led to down
regulation of AKT signaling as well as lack of IGF-I-induced IGF-1R
up-regulation in both IGF-1R (-/-) cell lines compared to empty
vector control cell lines. Interestingly, each TN cell line
underwent distinct morphological changes in response to IGF-1R
silencing. As evidenced by confocal microscopy and Western blot
analyses, MDA-MB-468 (epithelial) cells appeared to undergo
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) while MDA-MB-231
(mesenchymal) cells underwent mesenchymal to epithelial transition
(MET). Epithelial markers (E-cadherin and Î²- catenin)
and mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin) were also
differentially expressed in each IGF-1R (-/-) cell line.
Combinatorial inhibition of IGF-1R, EGFR, and/or mTOR decreased
cell survival more efficiently than single inhibition. These
results suggest that IGF-1R inhibition, in combination with EGFR
and/or mTOR down-regulation may provide clinical benefit in a
subset of TN breast cancer patients, particularly those with
mesenchymal-like tumor phenotypes.","Table of Contents -- I. Abstract -- II. Chapter 1: Introduction --

Entanglements of 'Development,' 'Citizenship,' and 'Cultural
Propriety'","Moldova is one of many new, multiethnic, sovereign states
struggling to maintain
its borders and generate enough loyalty to keep its population from
rebelling, or at least
keep its citizens from increasingly drifting away to richer
countries. Moldova gained its
independence 21 years ago, and the question of its citizens'
allegiances has been
important to the United States, the European Union, and Russia.
Some scholars doubt
that feelings of a cohesive society could exist in a Soviet state
fashioned out of several
historical regions in 1947, and containing many ethnolinguistic
groups. Thus, the central
questions guiding this dissertation are: What processes guide the
creation of a ""cohesive
society""? How is social cohesion related to shared cultural
experiences? And, How are
Moldovans navigating the transition of their lives from one type of
state (and one type of
citizenship) to another?
This work investigates contemporary common experiences of
Moldovans, more
narrowly asking how a ""citizen"" identity is constructed, as opposed
to an ethnic or
ethnonational identity. Drawing on literature from linguistic
anthropology and critical
discourse analysis, I hold that identities are formed through the
mutually constituting
relationship between discourse and culture. The majority of data
was collected through
ethnographic research with the Moldova Social Investment Fund
(MSIF). By a close
examination of the process by which applicants obtain an MSIF
grant, I show one way in
which Moldovans become exposed to Western ideologies and practices
of participatory
democracy and community development. I also demonstrate how the
ideologies
constitute powerful discursive formations that frame these new
practices as appropriate
means of building community cohesion. The relatively new discursive
formations were
compared to Moldovans' pre-existing ideas about development and
citizenship, which
intersect with, overlap, and challenge more contemporary discourses
of development and
citizenship. All of these are integrated, to varying degrees, into
what Moldovans consider
""proper"" ways of being, or what makes an acceptable member of
Moldovan culture and
society. Through examination of the discursive formations of
development, citizenship,
and cultural propriety, my dissertation shows how Western
ideals of civic behavior and
social cohesion are being integrated into Moldovan life via MSIF
development projects.","Chapter

Adaptation","This study considers the relationship between practices
and representations of autoeroticism and the practice of writing,
particularly as this relationship can illuminate understandings of
masculinities. By drawing representational examples from film,
literature and other media, this study deploys the figure of the
masturbating man as a site where queerness and abjection coalesce
around hetero-masculine identity. These cases studies and analyses
show that representations of masturbators are rich sites from which
heteromasculinity can be recuperated for queer readings that may
unlock subversive and nonnormative potentials in figures of
abjection, failure, and childishness. These readings reflect how
representations of masturbating men condition and construct men's
relationships to their own bodies, their sexual practices and
identifications through sexuality and gender. The first chapter
discusses Portnoy's Complaint (1969), considering how
Philip Roth constructs Alexander Portnoy as a figure of
contestation within cultural narratives of sexual liberation and
psychoanalysis whose autoerotic childishness can be read as a form
of resistance to normative heteromasculinity. The second chapter on
Adaptation (2002) examines how Charlie Kaufman's writing
practice and autoeroticism are linked in the film, primarily via
solitude and anti-sociality, but also, importantly through
imaginativity, creativity and fantasy. This second chapter argues
that the film productively narrativizes masturbation's generative
capacity and the ways in which it is imbricated in identity,
sociality, and masculinity. The third chapter of the thesis
broadens the scope of investigation to consider a variety
representational engagements from contemporary film and other media
with masturbating men and solitary sex in order to consider how
these texts shape cultural understandings of masculinity and
autoeroticism and how apparently heteronormative narratives can be
reread to produce masturbators as subversive figures.","Table of Contents --

published,emory:ft0pv,"Bhattacharyya, Debjani","Fictions of Possession: Land, Property and Capital in Colonial
Calcutta, c. 1820 to c. 1920","This dissertation studies the creation
of a market in urban land as a central project of colonial urbanism
in Calcutta from 1820 to 1920. It explores how a complex set of
human-land-water relations was translated into a recognizable
language of property. Broadly, it charts the birth of a specific
juridical notion of property bolstered by an economic narrative of
use shedding light upon colonial liberalism's unsettled relation to
property rights. More specifically, by analyzing instances of
land-acquisition, property disputes and regulation of housing
speculation in colonial Calcutta, it charts the process through
which ownership became financialized. Through this process of
financialization, a monetized value of land replaced a
social value in land as a possession involving a complex
system of patronage, gifting practices, ancestral spirits and
gods.
As Calcutta expanded from a trading post of the East
India Company to the second capital of the British Empire from 1757
to 1911, the politics of land as social capital was transformed
into a political economy of ownership. The decades following 1820
marked a crucial period in establishing laws pertaining to land
acquisition, land titles and property rights over ""alluvions."" The
legal ordering of spaces through the nineteenth century created new
narratives of law to render fictitious earlier existing authorities
and thereby delegitimizing various ways of dwelling in spaces. By
the early twentieth century, another kind of fiction emerged
encapsulated in the promise of a future value in land: a fiction
that made speculation possible. Through an intricate negotiation of
value as an economic, social and moral entity, land in colonial
Calcutta was transformed into capital. Simultaneously, various
narratives of possession authorized through maps, notarized
government paper, and property deeds restructured the urban power
networks.
In studying the transformation of the non-revenue
generating marshes into property this dissertation demonstrates
that law provided an important epistemological framework in the
development of imperial cartography and a propertied geography
throughout the nineteenth century. In mapping this particular
history of the production of urban property this dissertation
revealed the gap between the necessary and possible
juridico-economic definitions of property: a gap where multiple
ownership patterns exist.","Table of Contents -- Introduction: The ""Land"" Question: Property,

Activity Relationships of Novel GluN2C/D Subunit Selective
Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor","The N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ionotropic
glutamate receptors whose family members, identified by sequence
homology and pharmacology, comprise the
2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA),
kainate and delta receptors. The NMDA receptors respond to the
co-agonists glycine and glutamate and mediate the slow component of
excitatory neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system
(CNS). The functional NMDA receptor is a hetero-tetramer consisting
of two GluN1 subunits which bind to glycine and two GluN2 subunits
(GluN2A-D). Both the Glun1 subunits, which have eight different
splice variants, and the GluN2 subunits, which are encoded by four
distinct genes, can impart various unique functional and
pharmacological properties to the functional receptor, with the
GluN2 subunits having a greater impact on the various different
properties. While the receptors have been known and studied
intensely for several decades, until recently, subunit-selective
pharmacological tools remained elusive since the 1980s when the
first selective agent targeting GluN2B receptors was discovered and
characterized. This dissertation describes novel subunit-selective
allosteric modulators which target the GluN2C- and
GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors. The findings include the
identification of key structural determinants of activity for one
of the classes described, the identification of highly potent and
selective congeners within the same class, the stereochemical
preference of one of the more potent and selective members of the
small molecules, the beginning of the physicochemical property
optimization of the molecules and data and hypotheses suggesting
that distinct classes of molecules bind to a shared, or overlapping
site at the GluN2D containing receptors.","-- Chapter 1: Introduction --

Phonetic Correlates of Sound Symbolism
By Nihar M. Mathur

The sound structure of spoken language is widely assumed to bear an
exclusively
arbitrary relationship to meaning. However, recent research into
sound symbolism has
shown that listeners are sensitive to sound-to-meaning
correspondences that appear to
occur cross-linguistically. The current study evaluated potential
correspondences
between inventories of certain types of phonemes and particular
semantic domains.
Antonyms from different semantic domains were recorded from native
speakers of ten
different languages. Participants with no prior knowledge of the
languages were
presented with the sets of antonyms and asked to guess their
meanings. Broad phonetic
transcriptions of words referring to size (big/small),
contour (round/pointy), motion
(fast/slow), speed (still/moving), and valence
(bad/good) were analyzed to determine if
the phonemic profiles would differ as a function of meaning. In
general, vowel height
and consonant voicing distinguished words sounding big from small,
vowel roundedness
and the amount of vowels distinguished words sounding round from
pointy, vowel height
distinguished words sounding still from moving, and vowel height,
vowel roundedness,
and consonant sonority distinguished words sounding slow from fast.
No significant
differences seemed to cue listeners to distinguish words sounding
bad from good,
however. These findings illustrate a reliable sensitivity to the
mapping of certain speech
sounds to certain semantic domains.

Knowledge","This dissertation locates marginalized forms of knowledge in
recurrent metaphors circulating in the rhetorics of transgender
experience. A gendered identification that is not naturalized
generates an intensified pressure to speak (about) gender in the
absence of sanctioned vocabulary. This proliferation makes
transgender discourse a particularly useful object for studying how
gendered meaning is made. Investigating the rhetorical, cultural,
and political work of a persistent set of transgender tropes, my
project introduces the category of 'dysphoric knowledge' to
turn gender dysphoria from a diagnosis into a conceptual tool to
theorize minoritized and pathologized claims to knowledge and
embodiment of gender.
The project begins by tracing the medical history of the term
Gender Dysphoria and its role in Transgender Studies debates about
the trope of the ""wrong body,"" making the case for dysphoric
knowledge as a way of rethinking the field through a lens of
transgender rhetorics and knowledge production. Chapter two offers
a reading of shame and disgust in Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein through Silvan Tomkins' affect theory to argue
that the monster trope in transgender discourse negotiates
non-normative embodiment and its perceptions in the social world.
Chapter three argues that ghosts and hauntings in transgender
autobiography appear as figures of disrupted temporal and
pronominal narrative coherence, historical loss, and disembodiment,
while mirrors such as in The Well of Loneliness stage scenes
of dysphoric experiences of gender that find no reflection in
mirror models of knowledge. Chapter four discusses the skin suits
of violent transsexual movie tropes (The Skin I Live In,
Silence of the Lambs) and the cloth skins of a transgender
novel (Stone Butch Blues) to bring out the different logics
of skin and clothing as rhetorically gender-identity-laden
surfaces: Clothing operates according to a metaphorical logic,
while skin operates metonymically - in turn allowing for
epistemological and ontological claims, respectively. The final
chapter uses the examples of Peter Pan and the figure of the
transgender ""boi""/boy and of transgender women performing and
re-writing Eve Ensler's Vagina Monologues to argue that such
gender-specific tropes negotiate the place of transfemininity and
transmasculinity in feminism and can help articulate an inclusive
vision of feminism.",

II. Electrostatic Binding among Equilibrating 2-D and 3-D
Self-Assemblies","I. Self-Assembly of Thioether-Modified Cationic
Surfactants
Cationic surfactants with one or two sulfur atoms inserted at
various locations along their alkyl chains, were synthesized. Their
colloidal properties were thoroughly explored by surface tension,
fluorescence, and NMR. Furthermore, the thio-surfactants were
adsorbed into sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles. An oxidant,
periodate, was added to the system, and the subsequent rate of
thioether oxidation to sulfoxide, determined by in-situ NMR, was
found to be diminished (more or less equally for all sulfur loci)
by two orders of magnitude. In contrast, rates of hydrogen peroxide
oxidation were hardly perturbed by micellization. Once again,
however, there was no rate dependence on sulfur location within the
chains. These results are interpreted in terms of a disordered
micelle in which all chain positions have roughly equivalent access
to the micelle surface. The kinetic method for assessing exposure
to the external medium is applicable to self-assemblies and polymer
systems wherever the NMR resolution so permits.

II. Electrostatic Binding among Equilibrating 2-D and 3-D
Self-Assemblies
Six organic additives bearing a different number of anionic
charges, were added to a large excess of cationic surfactant
(dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, DTAB). The surface-tension vs.
log [DTAB] plot for solutions containing DTAB/trianion = 15:1
showed an abrupt break (routinely taken as the critical micelle
concentration, CMC) at 2.9 mM. This constitutes a 5-fold decrease
compared with a CMC of 15 mM for pure aqueous DTAB. There is a
10-fold decrease in the break-point concentration caused by a mere
3.3 mol-% of hexanion. Corresponding CMC values from DTAB/trianion
mixtures, measured by both conductivity and diffusion-NMR, gave
normal values of 14 mM. The unusual discrepancy between the CMC
based on surface tension and on the two ""bulk"" methods was
attributed to saturation of the air/water interface by a
DTAB/trianion complex far below the concentration at which the
micelles form. Thus, the sharp break seen in surface-tension ""CMC
plots"" need not in fact attest to actual micelle formation as is
almost universally assumed in colloid chemistry.","Table of Contents -- I. Self-Assembly of Thioether-Modified

homing CD8 T cells elicited","An efficacious HIV (Human immunodeficiency Virus) vaccine is
crucial to curb
the global pandemic of the disease, AIDS. Gene-based (DNA) and
viral-vector based
vaccines are two vaccine design strategies that are in advanced
stages of development.
Here, we investigate the potential of co-stimulation through 4-1BB
as an adjuvant for a
HIV-1 DNA vaccine in mice. We designed plasmid DNAs expressing
either the
membrane bound or soluble form of 4-1BBL, and compared with the
agonistic anti-4-
1BB Ab for their ability to adjuvant the Gag DNA vaccine. Both,
anti-4-1BB agonistic
Ab as well as 4-1BBL DNA enhanced the Gag-specific cellular immune
responses.
However, in complete contrast to the agonistic Ab that suppressed
humoral immunity to
Gag, 4-1BBL DNA adjuvanted vaccines enhanced Gag-specific IgG
responses.
Importantly, the expression of Gag and 4-1BBL from the same plasmid
was critical for
the adjuvant activity. Collectively, our data suggest that for a
HIV-1 vaccine, 4-1BBL
expressed by a DNA vaccine is a superior adjuvant than anti-4-1BB
agonistic Ab.
An effective HIV vaccine must also be able to confer protective
immunity at the
gut-associated mucosal tissue. Recent studies have shown that
intramuscular
immunization with some live viral vectors can prime
antigen-specific CD8 T cells with
gut homing potential. However, the mechanisms by which parenteral
immunizations
elicit antigen-specific CD8 T cells in the gut are not understood.
Here we show that an
adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) based HIV-1 vaccine primes a strong and
durable antigen-
specific CD8 T cell response in the gut following intramuscular
immunization in mice.
We also show that Ad5 rapidly induces expression of retinal
dehydrogenase enzymes in
splenic conventional DC (cDC) and enhances their ability to prime
antigen-specific CD8
T cells with gut homing specificity in vitro. This effect of
Ad5 did not require signaling
through toll-like receptors, DNA-dependent activator of IRFs and
several MAP kinases,
or replication capacity of the virus, but was dependant on
NF-ï«B. These results provide
an innate mechanism through which Ad5 primes antigen-specific CD8 T
cells with gut
homing potential and have implications for the development of novel
mucosal adjuvants
for subunit vaccines administered via the intramuscular
route.","Table of Contents -- Distribution Agreement -- Approval Sheet --

Antebellum United States","Abstract

""Directed Reading, Directed Writing"" contends that sentimental
narrative consistently
returns to the problem of its reception, to the power and danger of
the emotive reading it
seeks to produce. We see this concern both in sentimental novels
and in the world in
which they circulated: characters form deep, emotional attachments
to their beloved
books; letter-writing fans profess their devotion to an author
while scolding her for
failing to produce sequels; and anxious commentators worry about
the power that novels
exert over their audience. I attend to these moments in order to
unravel the networks that
unite author and reader through and around the sentimental text. I
argue that these
networks - dynamic, emotional relays among writers, texts, and
readers - allow authors
and audiences alike to imagine how reading sentimental narrative
affects both readers and
the world in which they live.

To pursue this claim, ""Directed Reading, Directed Writing"" turns to
a wide variety of
sources, including sentimental novels, nineteenth-century fan
letters, antebellum debates
about reading novels, and twentieth- and twenty-first-century
theories of affect. In the
antebellum United States, sentimental fiction operated as a crucial
site in which the
nation confronted the basic, but radical premise that reading can
entangle us - that it can
produce pleasure, passion, and change. By demonstrating how
sentimental fiction
insisted that writers and readers reconsider the very function of
reading, my project seeks
to push the critical discussion of sentimentality past its
political triumphs and
disappointments. Instead, I contend that the experience of reading
sentimental fiction
precedes and even licenses its political ramifications, and also
points to a broader
conception of the cultural work that sentimentality accomplished in
antebellum America.
Today, we continue to argue about why and how reading should
matter, and that
argument has become increasingly fraught as literary reading has
declined. ""Directed
Reading, Directed Writing"" suggests that we can look to the
nineteenth century for an
illustration of how the passions of literary reading might radiate
out into the public sphere
- and a way to finally name the risks and rewards of such a
thrilling pursuit.","Table of Contents -- Introduction -- Feeling and Reading Right -- 1

effects that the B-cell mediated humoral response has on
allografts. Unfortunately, the lack of knowledge about the signals
and mechanisms that govern this response has impeded the
development of an effective clinical treatment to counter it. This
research presents a proof of concept of a murine transplant model
system that is well suited to observe the B-cell mediated humoral
response to donor tissue. The system utilizes a combination of
advanced flow cytometric techniques, ELISA, and ELISPOT assays to
phenotype donor specific B-cells, track the kinetics of the
response, and quantify as well as qualify donor specific
antibodies. The use of the model system has made it possible to map
the kinetics of the humoral response to donor antigen and
demonstrate that a difference in duration of antigen exposure
affects the long-term humoral alloreactivity of an organism.
Furthermore, the model system has allowed for the phenotyping of
donor specific memory B-cells and has allowed for the
identification of an IgM expressing subset of memory B-cell that
has yet to be identified in a murine system. Lastly, the system was
applied to T-cell receptor knock out transgenic mice to demonstrate
that a long-term humoral response to allograft occurs in the
absence of T-cell help.","Introduction...........................................................................................

Human Papillomavirus Infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus
Infected Women: A Risk
Factor Analysis

By Joan E. Cain

Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the high
risk human papillomavirus (HR-
HPV) prevalence and specific risk factors for abnormal Papanicolaou
(Pap) smear in a human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected population. Additionally, the
utility of HPV viral load
using relative light unit (RLU) readings in predicting cervical
disease was assessed.
Methods. This is a cross-sectional study with 569
HIV-infected women who were enrolled from
six different cities across the United States. Risk factor analysis
was performed using
multivariate logistic regression.
Findings. A total of 486 HIV-infected women were included in
this analysis. HR-HPV was
found in 45% of the population with 25% having an infection with
type 16 or 18. For the group
as a whole, history of an abnormal Pap smear, CD4 count &lt;200,
history of antiretroviral use,
presence of HR-HPV regardless of RLU cut-off, and presence of low
risk HPV (LR-HPV) were
found to be risk factors for an abnormal Pap smear. On subgroup
analysis of those co-infected
with HR-HPV and HIV, history of antiretroviral use, RLU
â‰¥ 20, CD4 count &lt; 200, history of an
abnormal Pap smear, and infection with more than one HR-HPV type
were found to be risk
factors for an abnormal Pap smear. Finally, a strong association
between having an abnormal Pap
smear and presence of HR-HPV with an RLU â‰¥ 20
(RR=55.2) was found.
Conclusions: This study was able to identify important
predictors of having an abnormal Pap
smear in HIV-infected women which may help to individualize
follow-up and treatment. HPV
viral load as measured by RLU was found to be predictive of
cervical disease which could prove
useful in resource poor areas where further testing is not readily
available. Finally, only 25% of
those infected with HR-HPV were infected with either 16 or 18. This
implies that in HIV-
infected women the vaccine subtypes may need to be
broadened.","Table of Contents -- I. Introduction -- II. Background -- III.

""To Be Black and ""At Homeâ€Ÿ"": Movement, Freedom,
and Belonging in African
American and African Canadian Literatures
By
Kim D. Green
""""To Be Black and ""At Homeâ€Ÿ"" augments a
relatively understudied area of
African diasporic scholarship, comparative examination of African
American and African
Canadian literatures. I argue that African American and African
Canadian novelists
including Ann Petry and Austin Clarke provide nuanced
representations of the
experiences of people who persistently encounter discrimination
because of their
belongings to marginalized racial, gender, and class groups and
show how movements
such as national and transnational migration, educational
attainment, and economic
advancement can represent acts of resistance to inequitable
treatment. The selected
literary works also demonstrate how these physical, intellectual,
and economic
movements are affirmations of blacksâ€Ÿ right to
access national ideals of freedom,
equality, and justice in the United States and Canada. For example,
the black female
protagonists in Petryâ€Ÿs The Street (1946)
and Clarkeâ€Ÿs The Meeting Point (1967)
exercise
intellectual mobility to achieve their visions of economic
prosperity, which are
commensurate with ideals of freedom and equality that govern the
nations in which they
reside. As marginalized members of their national communities, they
learn that they do
not equally benefit from these ideals, but this lesson does not
prevent them from gaining
education and using other types of mobility to demand access to
opportunities for
economic success. Their employments of movement therefore become
acts of resistance
to discriminatory treatment and affirmations of their right to
achieve ideals of freedom
and equality in the nations they call home. Although I focus
primarily on African
American and African Canadian literatures, I assert that themes of
belonging, movement,
and freedom have the potential to unify diverse literatures and
cultures throughout the
African diaspora. Racism, for example, has specific manifestations
in particular nations
and cultures. However, people throughout the African diaspora
grapple with the
inhibiting consequences of belonging to marginalized racial groups.
Therefore, I argue
that literary works, historical analyses, and other diasporic texts
provide important
knowledge about ways in which particular belongings affect
opportunities for freedom
and various types of mobility in multiple national
locations.",

Age is a multi-model dissertation in two parts, consisting of
text and film, which explores representations of the rural- and
working-class South. The first part examines representations of
rural- and working-class white Southerners in photographs and film
from 1908 and 1974. The second part, a case study of cotton
deindustrialization in the rural South Carolina piedmont town of
Chester, combines a written micro-history of the decline of cotton
conglomerate Spring Industries with four short observational films
which capture particular aspects of that decline's aftermath.
The dissertation focuses on mill photographs of Springs's
presence in Chester in 1908, rural horror and hixploitation films,
Southern history, and documentaries. In doing so it draws on
primary sources of photographer Lewis Hine, filmmakers Roger
Corman, Monte Hellman, and Tobe Hooper, archival documents of
Springs Industries, and original production of observational
documentaries.
Since the founding of the American colonies, rural-and working
class Southerners are portrayed in particular, if not negative,
ways as backwards, lazy, and violent. These characterizations
persist in the American imagination and are reinforced by visual
images. As a consequence, the voices of such Southerners portrayed
in visual culture are lost in the din of broader representations.
Southern Community, Commerce and Representation in the Global
Age looks at particular examples of these stereotypes in films
and photographs, seeking to recover some of those voices.
It does so through the methods of photo-elicitation, historical
readings of rural horror and exploitation films, and production of
original documentaries. Such methods recover local history and
explore the historical motivations of rural characters in film,
allowing for a more nuanced lived history of Southern culture and
custom.
The second part of the dissertation, which involves the original
documentaries, extends these interventions by using the case study
of the decline of Springs Mills in Chester, South Carolina as a
departure point the ways in which film and historical text combine
to provide nuanced, particular portraits of the South which stand
in counterbalance to the broader portrayals in Part One.","-- Introduction 1-21 -- I.) Part One: Representations -- Chapter

to Influenza Vaccine Vectors and RNA Viral Infections in Mice","Influenza is a major health concern for humans and despite
intensive efforts, strategies to prevent and/or cure it have not
proven to be very successful. Viral mutants resistant to available
drugs are common and antigenic changes in the glycoproteins make it
necessary to frequently reformulate vaccine components. The work
presented herein examines numerous aspects of influenza and immune
responses to viruses in hopes of providing insights that may aid in
the development of improved anti-viral strategies and vaccines.
Drugs and vaccines that are able to effectively target conserved
components of influenza are likely to prove effective at targeting
multiple influenza subtypes. We have extended studies on one of
these potential targets, the fusion peptide of the HA, and
demonstrated that single residue deletions in this domain prevent
it from mediating fusion. These studies demonstrate length
constraints for the fusion peptide and may help lead to the design
of drugs that can target this conserved region of the virus.
Further work focuses on the ability of candidate influenza vaccines
containing disrupted NS1 proteins to elicit CTL responses. We show
that, although these viruses are severely attenuated, they are able
to generate potent memory CTLs and these are able to mediate viral
clearance. Several properties make influenza attractive as a
vaccine vector. We demonstrate that recombinant influenza vectors
containing inserts of Bacillus anthracis are able
to elicit antibody responses against these inserted domains and
that these responses can be boosted by heterologous vectors to
levels that are able to neutralize the anthrax toxin. However, CTLs
recognizing multiple strains of influenza inhibit previously
infected mice from developing antibody or CTL responses after
immunization with influenza vectors, although, these cross-reactive
cells are able to protect mice from challenges with heterosubtypic
viruses. Finally, we look at the longevity of humoral responses to
influenza, LCMV, and VSV in mice. We show that depletion of
naïve and memory B cells by rituximab results in a decrease of
virus-specific plasma cells. These data indicate that plasma cells
are intrinsically long-lived, but that some re-seeding by memory B
cells may be necessary to maintain their numbers long-term.","Table of Contents -- Abstract -- Acknowledgements -- Table of

Adenomatous Polyps","Background: Previous studies have
investigated an association between fish intake and risk for
colorectal cancer, but a possible relationship between fish
consumption and the precursor of colorectal cancer, adenomatous
polyps, is unknown.
Purpose: To investigate an association
between fish intake and risk of incident, sporadic colorectal
adenomatous polyps, alone and according to other risk
factors.
Methods: This case-control study was
part of the Minnesota Cancer Prevention Research Unit (CPRU)
program. Cases (n = 564) were patients aged 30 to 74 years with
pathology-confirmed adenomatous polyps of the colon or rectum. Two
control groups were recruited: colonoscopy-negative controls (n =
1,202) were colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy-confirmed polyp-free
participants, and community (CM) controls (n = 535) were subjects
randomly selected from the state driver's license registry and
frequency-matched to the cases on age, sex, and zip code. Data on
dietary intake were collected using a modified, 153-item Willett
food frequency questionnaire prior to colonoscopy.
Results: The multivariate-adjusted
odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the second
through the fourth quartiles of fish intake were, respectively,
1.29 (95% CI 0.91, 4.82), 0.88 (95% CI 0.62, 1.23), and 1.28 (95%
CI 0.87, 4.88) in comparison with the colonoscopy-negative
controls, and were similar to those in relation to the community
controls. The association did not differ substantially according to
other risk factors.
Conclusions: These results do not
support the hypothesis that greater fish intake may reduce risk for
incident, sporadic colorectal adenoma, although a possible modest
U-shaped association cannot be ruled out.","CHAPTER I: BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE

Perceptions, and Metabolic Effects","We conducted several multi-disciplinary studies to 1) evaluate
trends in the consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners over the last
decade using national-level data from five 2-year cycles of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2)
assess parental perceptions of non-nutritive sweeteners and
parents' ability to recognize non-nutritive sweeteners in packaged
foods and beverages, and 3) determine the acute effects of
sucralose on glycemia, satiety, gut hormone responses, and levels
of free fatty acids. We also conducted a review of existing
research assessing the consumption trends, regulations, and
recommendations for use of non-nutritive sweeteners in children,
which provided an opportunity to synthesize available data
assessing their effects on glycemia, energy intake, body weight,
and taste preferences in pediatric populations.
We found that the consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners has
increased dramatically in the United States over the last decade,
among both children and adults. Furthermore, our data demonstrated
that parents are largely unable to identify foods and beverages
which contain non-nutritive sweeteners. Parents however expressed
overall negative attitudes toward providing non-nutritive
sweeteners to their children, despite these widespread increases in
their consumption. Meanwhile, our metabolic data do not suggest
harmful effects of short-term consumption of non-nutritive
sweeteners on glycemia, satiety, or glucose kinetics. Future
studies are needed to assess the metabolic consequences of long
term exposure to non-nutritive sweeteners and to determine the
impact of non-nutritive sweeteners on dietary patterns and taste
preferences. This knowledge will allow us to develop evidence-based
recommendations for the use of non-nutritive sweeteners as a
replacement for added sugars in the general population.","--  -- Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION..

published,emory:50s1p,"Lynch, Sean ","From Aptamer to Riboswitch: High-throughput Screens and Selections
for the Identification and Creation of Synthetic Riboswitches","The discovery of metabolite responsive riboswitches in bacteria
supported the
notion that ligand-binding RNA molecules could be used to control
bacterial gene
expression. Riboswitches are comprised of small-molecule binding
sequences of RNA,
known as ""aptamers"", linked to ""expression platforms"", which
translate the binding of
a small molecule into a change in gene expression. While the number
of engineered
systems described in the literature utilizing RNA-small molecule
interactions to control
gene expression is limited, the principles driving their function
are straightforward.
Therefore, it is tempting to believe that in vitro selected
aptamers could be readily used in
the development of synthetic riboswitches that respond to new
ligands.
In this thesis we describe a series of high-throughput screens
and selections for
the identification and creation of dynamic synthetic riboswitches
in bacteria that respond
to the small molecule, theophylline. We present a high-throughput,
enzymatic assay that
successfully identifies synthetic riboswitches with improved
dynamic ranges. These new
switches display essentially no background translation in the
absence of their
small-molecule effector, and large increases in its presence.
Sequence data, coupled with
in vitro and in vivo studies, enabled the development of a model
describing their function
where a transcript's secondary structure influences the translation
of the downstream
genes.
A second high-throughput screen capable of rapidly identifying
synthetic
riboswitches using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) is
also described. The
throughput of this screen approaches that of a genetic selection
and was successfully used
to identify riboswitches with capabilities that match or exceed
those of most natural
riboswitches. Characterization of these switches indicated the
capacity of the ribosome
binding site to dramatically alter the dynamic behavior of a
synthetic riboswitch.
Using what we had learned about the function of theophylline
riboswitches, we
endeavored to select an RNA aptamers that binds the antibiotic
erythromycin and
subsequently attempted to integrate these aptamers into
erythromycin-sensitive
riboswitches using a genetic selection scheme. Despite limited
success, the analysis of a
single aptamer has revealed features that may guide the
semi-rational design of a new
erythromycin riboswitch and future efforts to select RNA aptamers
for use in engineered
riboswitches.","Contents -- Chapter 1:

Action","In the midst of international development efforts, a
creative approach to development has emerged: Theatre for
Development (TfD). TfD takes the form of a theatre workshop that
explores obstacles to development and proposes potential solutions
to such obstacles. Workshops are designed to incite collective
action within the communities they take place in. It is through
this collective action that TfD aims to establish development
initiatives which improve the standard of living available to
partner communities. This thesis analyzes four TfD
techniques-cultivation of local relationships, community script
drafting, improvisation, and post-show discussions-to determine
which techniques are most efficacious in the TfD process. It was
found that local relationships and community script drafting are
especially effective, while improvisation and post-show discussions
might also aid the cultivation of collective action. Additionally,
this study identified other factors which influence the efficacy of
TfD: repetitive workshops, communal willingness to participate,
culture, and additional contextual factors. It is suggested that
future research explore the role these factors play in TfD's
ability to produce collective action.","Table of Contents --

of Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase","Nucleoside analogs (NAs) are widely used as prodrugs, such as in
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and chemotherapy. NAs
require cellular enzymes to convert them into their active
triphosphate form in order to be incorporated into DNA by low
fidelity polymerase such as HIV reverse transcriptase or polymerase
β in cancer cells during replication cycle, functioning as
reverse transcriptase and polymerase inhibitor. Phosphorylation of
NAs to monophosphates by deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs) is
usually the 'bottle neck' in prodrug activation. Engineering
2Ê¹-deoxyribonucleoside kinases with higher activity and
orthogonal specificity for nucleoside analogs is under intensive
study. However, the directed evolution of dNKs is hampered by a
lack of efficient library screening techniques. A method combining
fluorescent nucleoside analogs with fluorescent-active cell sorting
(FACS) has been developed in our lab and evaluated by evolving
Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (
Dm-dNK) using fluorescent
2Ê¹,3Ê¹-dideoxythymidine (fddT) as substrate.
As part of my thesis, I have prepared a fluorescent
3Ê¹-fluoro-2Ê¹-deoxyuridine (fFT) and explored
its use to evolve kinases that are specific to
3Ê¹-fluoro-2Ê¹-deoxyuridine (FT). My results
show that the partial hydrogen bond interaction between the
3Ê¹ fluoro moiety and active site residues is beneficial
for enrichment of desirable Dm-dNK mutants by FACS.
Seperately, I have investigated alternative fluorescent probes that
do not clash with residues in the active site, employing 1,
3-dipolar cycloaddition of alkenophiles with diaryl-tetrazoles.","1

Mechanisms of
outside-in JAM-A mediated signaling
By Eric A.
Severson
 
JAM-A is a
transmembrane component of tight junctions that regulates multiple
processes, yet studies on the mechanism of JAM-A function are
lacking. We hypothesized that the ability of JAM-A to dimerize was
necessary for the mechanism of JAM-A function. Overexpression of
dimerization-defective JAM-A mutants or treatment with a
dimerization inhibiting antibody in 293T cells reduced cell
migration across permeable filters. Analyses of cells expressing
the JAM-A dimerization-defective mutant proteins revealed
diminished β1 integrin protein. A functional link between
JAM-A and β1 integrin was confirmed by restoration of cell
migration to control levels after overexpression of β1
integrin in JAM-A dimerization-defective cells. To extend upon
these results, we reported that JAM-A is physically and
functionally associated with the PDZ domain containing signaling
molecules Afadin and PDZ-GEF2, but not ZO-1, in the intestinal
epithelial cell line SK-CO15. Both Afadin and PDZ-GEF2 were
observed to co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with JAM-A. Loss
of JAM-A, Afadin or PDZ-GEF2, but not ZO-1 or PDZ-GEF1, similarly
decreased cellular levels of activated Rap1, β1 integrin
protein and the rate of epithelial cell migration. The effects
observed were secondary to decreased levels of Rap1A since
knockdown of Rap1A resulted in decreased β1 integrin protein
and cell migration. These findings suggest that JAM-A dimerization
leads to the close apposition of Afadin and PDZ-GEF2. The proximity
of PDZ-GEF2 and Afadin results in activation of Rap1A. Active Rap1A
stabilizes β1 integrin protein levels, which controls the rate
of cell migration. These results illustrate a novel mechanism for
JAM-A signaling based on its structural motifs.","Introduction...........................................................................................1

ecological sanitation system in El Alto, Bolivia","An estimated 64 million Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs)
are lost to diseases caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation and
poor hygiene every year, mostly in developing countries. Ecological
sanitation (Ecosan) provides low-cost sanitation appropriate for
many developing regions, funded through the sale and reuse of
excreta for horticultural applications. Reuse of incompletely
sanitized excreta may result in transmission of infectious agents,
especially the ova of helminths such as Ascaris
lumbricoides. Composting with earthworms, or vermicomposting,
is a potential sanitization technique, but has received little
formal study. To address this knowledge gap and provide guidance
for a Bolivian NGO managing an Ecosan system in El Alto, Bolivia,
Ascaris ova were quantified in samples of vermicomposts
after 3, 6, 8, 13, or 18 months of composting. Bayesian models of
inactivation of Ascaris in the vermicomposts estimated
97.5th percentile times for 90% inactivation of
thousands of months, and did not indicate statistically significant
decay over time. Best-case estimates of the median annual burden of
disease for consumers of raw produce fertilized with vermicompost
ranged from 1.64*10-5 to 8.25*10-2
DALYs/person/year, depending on produce type and the dose-response
model used. Best-case estimates of the median annual burden of
disease for agricultural workers laboring on plots fertilized with
vermicompost ranged from 6.05*10-7 to
1.98*10-2 DALYs/person/year. Best-case estimates of the
median annual burden of disease for children playing in parks
fertilized with vermicomposts ranged from 9.05*10-4 to
6.84*10-2 DALYs/person/year. Estimated burdens of
disease for most scenarios did not fall below 10-4
DALYs/person/year unless the concentration of viable Ascaris
ova in the vermicompost was at levels undetectable
(â‰¤0.25 ova/g total solids) by the USEPA method
for Ascaris detection in biosolids. Due to the
unacceptably high burdens of disease estimated for children and
consumers of produce, even when ova concentrations are below the
limit of detection, a conservative recommendation to protect public
health is to restrict application of biosolids from public spaces
and crops that might be eaten raw unless helminth infections are
known to be extremely rare in the population. Future research is
recommended to address assumptions made in the risk models
constructed for the present study.","Role

and preterm birth","This study was a secondary data analysis that examined the
relationship between maternal residential proximity to Toxics
Release Inventory (TRI) sites and preterm birth (PTB). A secondary
outcome of interest was low birth weight (LBW). Study
participants included 21,314 randomly selected singleton live
births in Texas from 2001 to 2005 without congenital anomalies.
Among total births, 8.53% were preterm and 5.82% were LBW, with and
increased prevalence of PTB (11.31%) and LBW (9.58%) among
non-Hispanic blacks. Geocoded maternal residence and ambient air
pollution emission data from 977 TRI sites was used to determine
exposure status. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), births
with maternal residence within a one mile radius of a TRI site were
classified as exposed. The effect of total emissions as well as
specific chemical emissions or groups of chemical emissions
on gestational age at birth and birth weight was explored.
The prevalence of exposure varied from 1.14% to 13.54% depending on
the exposure group of interest. Logistic and linear regression
models controlling for several known risk factors of PTB and LBW
were used to analyze the data in Statistical Analysis Software
(SAS). Results for all regression models were generally consistent
with no association. The null results may be partially attributable
to non-differential exposure misclassification. This study found no
evidence of a relationship between maternal residential proximity
to TRI sites and PTB or LBW for any chemical exposure groups of
interest. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship for
any exposure of interest. There was also no significant or

GENITAL ABNORMALITIES, AND HIV PREVALENCE, TRANSMISSION, AND
ACQUISITION IN LUSAKA, ZAMBIA","Background: A reported 33.3 million people living in
Sub-Saharan Africa are infected
with HIV. In Zambia, the estimated HIV prevalence ranges from 13.5%
- 17%. An
estimated 20.7% of children in Zambia are infected with
schistosomiasis, a parasitic
infection second only to malaria in prevalence, morbidity and
mortality in Africa.
Individuals who are infected with schistosomiasis can develop
symptoms that last a
lifetime. Symptoms of schistosomiasis include genital
abnormalities, such as ulcers or
""sandy patches"" that could increase the susceptibility or
transmission of HIV.
Objective: This study examines the statistical associations
between antibody to
schistosomiasis and HIV prevalence, acquisition and transmission,
and the presence of
genital abnormalities.
Methods: 2168 individuals who were followed in the
Zambia-Emory HIV Research
Project heterosexual cohort for at least three months were included
in this study. Using
banked plasma and serum samples, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA) were
completed to detect schistosomiasis antibody titers. Clinical
health data were obtained
from medical history and physical exams completed at ZEHRP
enrollment visits.
Univariate logistic regressions were conducted to analyze the
associations between
antibody titer to schistosomiasis; HIV prevalence, acquisition and
transmission; and
genital abnormalities.
Results: Antibodies to schistosomiasis, overall, were not
significantly associated with
being HIV-positive at baseline or transmitting HIV. Schistosomiasis
infection was
significantly associated with the presence of some genital
abnormalities, including
inguinal adenopathy, inflammation of the cervix in women, and
gonorrhea.
Discussion: This study provides a snapshot of the possible
complications that can
arise from being previously infected with schistosomiasis, in the
context of the HIV
epidemic. Interestingly, it does not seem as if serologic evidence
of past or present
schistosomiasis infection is a significant risk factor for
transmission of HIV. Future
directions could take into account the timeline of events and
whether an individual
acquires or transmits HIV due to the presence of genital
abnormalities caused by
schistosomiasis, or if HIV exacerbates the effects of
schistosomiasis. Furthermore,
ELISA results should be followed up with Western immunoblots to
identify Schistosoma
mansoni versus S. haematobium infection, and to confirm
previous schistosomiasis
infection, particularly in individuals with intermediate
titers.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND -- HIV Prevalence

Use of an Inducible Gene System to Study the Dynamics of the
Drosophila Dosage Compensation Complex
In Drosophila, males have one transcribing X chromosome
while females have two transcribing X chromosomes. The males and
females need to transcribe equal amounts of the genes on the X
chromosome and achieve dosage compensation. The Male Specific
Lethal (MSL) complex is responsible for making this happen. The MSL
complex acetylates histones, specifically H4K16, which loosens the
chromatin and increases the accessibility of the X chromosome,
allowing hypertranscription in males. A mystery lies in how the MSL
complex is recruited to active genes and spreads on the X
chromosome. Two ideas exist: one, the MSL complex could start at
the promoter region and move towards the 3' end of the gene; two,
the MSL complex moves in an opportunistic manner to the transcribed
region where it modifies the histones between the passages of RNA
Polymerase II (Pol II) molecules (Lucchesi, 2009). To figure out
this aspect of the MSL complex, an inactive gene that can be
activated and that recruits the MSL complex needs to be examined.
Previous work by Boehm with Drosophila melanogaster used
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on the inactive, activatable
hsp70 (heat-shock protein 70) gene to examine the movements
of different proteins before and after transcription is initiated.
A hsp gene would be suitable for similar studies with the
MSL complex but none exists on the X chromosome. Such a gene is on
the XR chromosome of D. pseudoobscura. The purpose of this
study is to demonstrate that after ensuring its inactive state the
hsp28 gene on the XR chromosome of D. pseudoobscura
can be activated and is able to recruit the MSL complex, so that it
can be used to clarify where the MSL complex is recruited and how
it enhances transcription.

Unprotected Sex among a Cohort of HIV sero-discordant Couples in
Lusaka, Zambia (1994 - 2012)","Background: Under-reporting of sexual
behavior in HIV prevention efforts compromise the accuracy of
predicting sero-discordant couples likely to transmit infections to
negative partners. Here we examine the reliability of self-reports
of unsafe sexual behaviors using 4 biological measures of
unprotected sex and the association between time to unprotected sex
and predictors collected at enrollment and during follow
up.
Methods: HIV discordant heterosexual
couples were followed at a CVCT center from 1994 to 2012. Baseline
and time varying factors were measured. The outcome was a
time-varying composite measure of any: self-reported unprotected
sex, sperm present on a wet prep, incident pregnancy, and incident
HIV/STI. A repeated outcomes survival analysis with time-varying
covariates explored factors associated with unprotected
sex.
Results: Among 3,049 couples followed
for an average of two years, any indication of unprotected sex
occurred during 62% of study intervals. In the unadjusted analysis,
younger age of the male partner ((M-F+: HR 0.995 p=0.002, M+F-: HR
0.99 p &lt;0.0001), female partner (M-F+: HR 0.995 p=0.011, M+F-:
HR 0.992 p =0.003), fewer number of years co-habiting (M-F+: HR
0.992 p=0.008, M+F-: HR 0.991 p =0.003), age difference (M-F+: HR
0.995 p=0.04, M+F-: HR 0.991 p=0.02), male partner use of alcohol
(M+F-: HR 1.114 p=0.01), female partners number of lifetime sex
partners (M-F+: HR 1.092 p=0.002), circumcision of the male partner
(M+F-: HR 0.886 p=0.032), self-reported condom use by female
partner (M-F+: HR 0.812 p&lt;0.0001, M+F-: HR 0.756 p &lt;0.0001),
being pregnant at interval visits (M-F+: HR 1.304 p&lt;0.0001,
M+F-: HR 1.341 p &lt;0.0001) were significant predictors of
unprotected sex. Multivariate analyses showed that a higher number
of lifetime sex partners for the female partner (aHR: 1.003, 95%
CI: 1.002, 1.004), a positive history of STI in the past year for
the male partner (aHR: 1.149, 95% CI: 1.062, 1.243) and being
pregnant at any interval visit (aHR: 1.191, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.314)
were significant predictors for the M-F+ couples while consistent
protected sex with the study partner (aHR: 0.795, 95% CI: 0.658,
0.961), being pregnant at any interval visit (aHR: 1.253, 95% CI:
1.113, 1.41) and use of either oral (OCP) or injectable (INJ)
contraceptives at interval visits were important predictors of
unprotected sex for the M+F- couples.
Conclusions: Our study provides
further evidence that gross under-reporting of unsafe sexual
practices is very likely by couples in discordant relationships and
caution must be exercised when using self-reports to determine a
discordant couple's risk of HIV transmission to the negative
partner.",

From Duty, to Torture, to the Highest Bidder:
Habitus and the Evolution of South Africa's Security Forces
South Africa's security apparatus was a ful and active force in the
story of apartheid. Mid-­‐
ranking Afrikaner police officers and soldiers had surprising
amounts of influence on their
respective institutions. As the forces on the ground during unrest
in the townships and in
guerril a fights abroad, these mid-­‐ranking officers'
daily experiences shaped the reality of South
African national security policies. An examination of the formative
cultural and experiential
factors, or habitus, that shaped the security forces can explain
both the actions of the security
forces during apartheid, and also the ascendancy of the private
security industry in present-­‐day
South Africa. The influence of the private security sector today is
a testament to the habitus
developed amongst the security forces. This habitus had great
impact upon the story of
apartheid. Its legacy is continued in the proliferation of private
security companies, which
maintain many of the dividing facets of South African society. The
provision of private security
services link South Africa's security sector to its apartheid past,
and prove that the legacy of
apartheid security forces reverberates in modern South

Acknowledging Difference: Looking at Film, Looking at Food
Acknowledging difference is a matter of perceiving
distinctions-distinctions that often go unsaid, are
overlooked, or are simply ignored. This mixed media project of
stop-motion animation with a self-
reflexive paper accompaniment calls attention to the inherent
differences in the products of both film and
food, focusing on the perception of the Handmade product.
Stop-motion film form alienates the viewer
from the ""normal"" looking structure, inviting the perceiver to
actively partake in the digestion of visual
information. My food images too are alienating as I restrain from
the usual illustration; food is depicted
as neither beautiful nor grotesque, my purpose being that the
viewer looks at the food objectively. The
accompanying paper revolves around the senses of touch and feeling.
Stop-motion animation, and
Handmade film form in general, reinstate the touch of the flesh
hand back into the visual information of
the mechanical language of Cinema. It demands an acknowledgement of
the filmmaker, both in body and
mind. The intent of the visuals, the time of the work, and the
energy of the labor, are all very present
factors in the film text. Whereas with the mechanical fluidity of
Industrialized film form, it very much
obscures not only the filmmaker's presence, but the distance
between the world of the film object and the
world of the perceiver. As an embodied perceiver, the viewer is
then positioned in a passive-looking
structure within the Cinematic space of industrialized film,
unaware of the differences in tempo-spatiality
and body forms. It is my intention to explore the different kind of
looking structure positioned by the
Handmade product and how a certain pleasure from a genuine
figured-out knowledge surfaces from such
a structure and form.","Table of Contents -- An Introduction -- 1 -- Sensing Essence -- 3

Elements and Candidate Trans-factors
","Abstract

Cells regulate immediate early
gene expression levels by adjusting the rates of gene transcription
and mRNA decay. Initially, significant emphasis was placed on the
role of transcriptional regulation in these responses following
cell signaling, but recent evidence increasingly suggests
regulation also occurs at the post-transcriptional level.
Determining what processes contribute to experimentally observed
changes in RNA stability presents a significant challenge. The goal
of this work was to provide an improved understanding of how cells
couple extracellular signaling events to changes in RNA metabolism.
The first phase of this research set out to evaluate the ability of
existing methods to identify trans-acting proteins
that interact specifically with known functional cis-acting RNA regulatory elements. Several methods were
stringently tested including multiple RNA immunoprecipitation
techniques and a yeast 3 hybrid screen. For all methods, results of
specificity assessment experiments revealed serious limitations. In
a first effort to address this specificity problem, I chose to take
a more functional approach by testing whether the S.
cerevisiae GPCR-controlled mating pathway makes use of
post-transcriptional regulation to alter steady-state RNA levels.
The ability to model this type of regulated stability in yeast
would not only allow for the identification of novel
post-transcription factors, but it would also expand the repertoire
of approaches to discover the specific processes targeted by
signaling to effect the observed changes in RNA turnover. Since my
data indicate that S. cerevisiae apparently lacks
this mode of regulation, it was feasible to build a novel system
that could be used to identify new proteins that interact with
functional signal-regulated RNA elements. I therefore developed and
deployed a novel yeast-based screening system that is capable of
detecting the interaction between functional RNA cis-elements and candidate RNA binding proteins. The true
value and novelty of this system is that it can read out a genetic
interaction without prejudice to the mechanism of
post-transcriptional regulation. Using this system, I have
identified a novel interacting protein for the COX2 mRNA and have
contributed to our understanding of how cells couple extracellular
signaling events to changes in RNA metabolism.","Table of Contents --  -- Chapter 1: Introduction.

published,emory:gtdq8,"Georgiopoulou, Vasiliki (Vicki)","Functional Capacity and Risk for Heart Failure in Older
Adults","Functional capacity is associated with several risk factors for
heart failure (HF), including cardiovascular disease, elevated
blood pressure, and diabetes; and also with mortality. Fit
individuals have less risk for cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, or diabetes, and lower mortality. Heart failure is an
important public health problem with high socioeconomic burden and
is significantly associated with age. Therefore, increasing
physical activity at the population level might reduce the risk for
HF and mortality. Several tests have been used to evaluate
functional capacity. Walking tests are the most widely used,
because of their simplicity and need of no special equipment or
setting. The 6-minute walk test and its variants are widely used
for prognostic reasons. However, because of the low ceiling and
learning effect of 6-minute walk test, new walking tests have been
introduced, especially for special populations. The long distance
corridor walk (LDCW) test, introduced in the Health Aging and Body
Composition (Health ABC) study, helps older individuals approach
their maximum capacity, correlates strongly with oxygen
consumption, and carries important prognostic information for
mobility limitation and disability, cardiovascular disease, and
all-cause mortality in older adults. There are limited data
connecting functional capacity and incident HF in middle-aged
individuals, and no data are available in older adults who have the
highest rates for HF development. Therefore, evaluating the
association of functional capacity with HF risk and mortality in
older adults using data from well-designed cohort studies is a
crucial step to inform the design of interventional studies. In
this work, we examine the association between functional capacity,
as assessed with the LDCW test, and risk for HF and mortality in
older adults. For this purpose, we used 10-year follow-up data from
the NIH-funded Health ABC Study, a population-based cohort of 3075
well-functioning, community-dwelling participants aged 70 to 79
years at inception (1997-1998) from Pittsburgh, PA, and Memphis,
TN. We evaluated the association between exercise performance and
cardiovascular responses recorded during the baseline (year 1) LDCW
test and outcomes. Specifically for HF, we considered also the
competing risk of mortality using appropriate statistical models.
In multivariable models, we adjusted for risk factors previously
linked to mortality and incident HF in this cohort along with other
parameters linked with reduced functional capacity. Finally, we
examined for modification effects of gender, race, and pre-existing
cardiovascular disease on the association between functional
capacity and 10-year outcomes (mortality and incident HF).","1.

English","This paper examines the use of the word any from
Old English through Early Modern English. In present-day English,
any is a clear example of a negative polarity item (NPI).
NPIs are word or phrase that can appear grammatically under
negation, in conditional clauses, in questions, and as a standard
of comparison, but are not grammatical in affirmative sentences.
For example, it is grammatical to say â€˜I don't
have any apples', but it is ungrammatical to say
â€˜I have any apples'. The traditional story told
in the literature is that any became an NPI between Late
Middle English and Early Modern English as a result of the loss of
negative concord. Using corpora of Old English, Middle English, and
Early Modern English, I found something quite different. In the Old
English corpus, any appears with high frequency under
negation. This frequency drops in Middle English, and then rises
again in Early Modern English. Much of this paper seeks to explain
this U-shaped trend in the historical distribution of any. I
argue that, contrary to the traditional view, any was an NPI
throughout Old English, Middle English, and Early Modern English. I
propose a four-staged model to explain the U-shaped curve.","--  -- List of Tables. 1 -- List of
