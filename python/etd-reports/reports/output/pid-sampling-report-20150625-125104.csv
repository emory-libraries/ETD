Henry James","A number of scientific and technological innovations that came
about during the
nineteenth century had a resounding effect on Victorian culture.
The advent of the
railway along with the introduction of new communications media and
radical biological
and geological discoveries had major implications for western
society's understanding of
the relationship between space and time and of humanity's role
within that relationship.
As time and space were expanded, the speed at which they could be
experienced caused
them to be simultaneously annihilated, greatly increasing the
number of impressions -
and the amount of experience - an individual could acquire. By the
1890s, the effects of
this phenomenon had become some of the most widely discussed topics
in a multitude of
cultural discourses, and since, as H. Porter Abbott writes in the
Cambridge Introduction
to Narrative, ""the representation of conflict in narrative
provides a way for a culture to
talk to itself about, and possibly resolve, conflicts that threaten
to fracture it (or at least
making living difficult),"" the literature produced during the last
decade of the century
exemplifies the extent to which these changes influenced society on
both individual and
collective levels.1 This thesis focuses on two works by Henry James
- The Turn of the
Screw and In the Cage, both published in 1898 - as well
as H. G. Wells's The Time
Machine, published in 1895. Shortly after these works were
introduced into Victorian
culture, James and Wells became involved in a lifelong quarrel
regarding the purpose of
the novel: Wells adeptly explained it in a 1915 letter to James
when he stated, ""to you
literature like painting is an end, to me literature like
architecture is a means, it has a
use.""2 Despite their differences - as Wells confessed, ""I had a
queer feeling that we were
both incompatibly right"" - both authors address the newly-realized
ambiguity of the
relationships between time and space, truth and fiction, man and
machine.3","Table of Contents --

inactive,emory:g2cm7,"Goldfeder, Mark Aaron",Chains of Love in Law; Revisiting Plural Marriage,"This dissertation explores an area at the intersection of
family law, religious liberty and criminal law: the issue of plural
marriage. As American keeps moving in the direction of favoring
consensual adult relationships regardless of their nature, polygamy
has been slowly making a comeback in the national consciousness.
Arguments include First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to
religious liberty, due process, and equality. The first part of
this dissertation explores the issue of legalizing plural marriage
from a legislative and administrative standpoint, while the second
part argues that, regardless of whether or not the technicalities
can be worked out on paper, from a public policy perspective,
polygamy is a poor choice. It argues from experience, with detailed
reference to the Jewish legal system's dramatic move away from the
practice of plural marriage.","Table of Contents -- INTRODUCTION.......................................................................................................................................................................

James in the ""Q"" Sayings Tradition: An Examination of the
Jesus Logia in the Epistle of St. James
The present investigation concerns itself with assessing the
relationship between the Epistle of
James and the sayings traditions of Jesus, as found in the
Synoptics. For most observers, the use of Jesus
logia
reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the nature and
extent of the affinities between James and the Gospels remain a
matter of debate among scholars. The
questions raised
revolve around debates over which
passages in James are identifiable as derivative of a Jesus
logion. Secondarily, the extent to which James
utilizes such traditions has been recognized as a possible window
into the Sitz im Leben of the Jamesian
community (itself a notoriously difficult question).
The thesis which guides the present discussion can be stated as
follows: the Epistle of James
represents an early stage in the development of the Jesus tradition
found in the Synoptic Gospels.
Correspondingly, it reflects a pre-gospel stage of development in
the sayings of Jesus, reminiscent of the
form found in the Q source (particularly in its Matthean
recension). The two test cases for this hypothesis
will be Jas 2:5 and Jas 5:12. The reason for the selection of these
passages in particular is that they are
nearly universally accepted
of the words of Jesus. Before undertaking
an exegesis of these passages it will be necessary to briefly
review the relevant literature, in order to see
how Jamesian scholarship has developed from its origins to its
current state. Following the exegesis of the
targeted verses in James, we will conclude our investigation with a
summary of our findings and an
assessment of their implications.

Inflammation during Disturbed Flow-Induced Atherogenesis in Mouse
Carotid Artery","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in the United States. The leading cause of
CVD is the progressive growth of lipid-laden plaques within the
large arteries of the body, a process known as atherosclerosis.
This inflammatory disease is characterized by the infiltration of
immune cells into the artery wall at sites that are chronically
exposed to disturbed patterns of blood flow (d-flow). Immune cells
accumulate within the artery wall where they establish the
sustained, local inflammation required to drive plaque development.
While the immunogenesis of atherosclerosis has been extensively
studied over the past decade or so, the relationship between d-flow
and immune cell function in the vasculature remains poorly
understood. In order to overcome this knowledge gap, we used a
partial carotid ligation model to generate d-flow in the left
common carotid artery (LCA), which induces the rapid development of
atherosclerosis within 2 weeks along the entire length of LCA in
apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed a high-fat
diet (HFD). We developed a 10-fluorochrome, 13-parameter, flow
cytometry-based immunophenotyping method to quantify the
infiltration of 7 major classes of immune cells into flow-disturbed
LCA during rapid atherogenesis. Using this method we provide the
first quantitative description of vascular leukocyte number and
composition over the entire lifespan of murine atherosclerosis, and
showed that d-flow induces rapid and dynamic accumulation of
monocyte/macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, NK cells, and
T-cells within 4 days. Leukocyte numbers peaked by 7 days,
preceding atheroma development in LCA by day 14 days post-ligation.
qPCR and ELISA arrays showed that leukocyte infiltration
corresponds with the onset of progressive pro-inflammatory cytokine
and chemokine expression in the artery wall, demonstrating the
close link between d-flow, vascular leukocyte recruitment, and
atherosclerosis. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBLs) in our model showed that d-flow powerfully
inhibits hyperlipidemia-induced leukocytosis in ligated versus
sham-operated controls, suggesting that localized d-flow can
influence immune function on a systemic level, independent of
classical atherosclerosis risk factors such as hyperlipidemia.
Together, our studies establish partial carotid ligation as an
important experimental model to study the interface between
vascular physiology, immunopathology, and
atherosclerosis.","--  -- Chapter 1: General Introduction 1 -- 1.1

Literary Collections","Authors endow their literary collections to academic
archives in order to ensure their enduring legacy as writers.
Archival institutions pledge not only to organize and preserve an
author's papers, but also to promote the writers they acquire to
future readers and scholars. While literary collections housed in
academic libraries are a relatively contemporary, twentieth-century
occurrence, it is only in more recent decades that authors began
creating, selling, and monitoring the use of their own materials
rather than choosing to have their papers preserved and
disseminated after their death. By taking proactive steps to ensure
their legacy, writers such as Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, and
Lucille Clifton have begun to influence the development of literary
criticism and the narration of literary history. My dissertation
intervenes in two disciplines, showing that in archival studies,
scholars focus on historical materials and miss the unique history
of twentieth-century literary collections, while in literary

published,emory:brhw0,"Yerian, Sarah Ellen","The Role of Women in Water Management and Conflict Resolution in
Marsabit, Kenya","Background: Marsabit is a semi-arid district in northern
Kenya where conflicts over
scarce water sources can limit access to water. Management of
sources is a potential way
to mitigate these conflicts, and the involvement of women in
management is recognized
as important. Little evidence exists on how women can be
effectively involved in
management decisions or how their involvement can reduce conflict
and increase access
to water sources in Marsabit.
Objective: This study explores the types and nature of
conflict over scarce water sources
in Marsabit, Kenya, how they impact women, and the role that women
play in water
management and conflict resolution.
Methods: Key informant interviews (KIIs) (n=10) with local
officials provided
background information on water conflicts and identified specific
topics to cover in focus
group discussions. Focus group discussions (FGDs) (n=16) with men
and women
investigated community experiences of water conflict and
perceptions of women in
management. Unstructured observation at water points complemented
information from
the FGDs.
Results: Themes from the FGDs indicated that conflicts at
water points occur among
livestock users, among domestic users, and between livestock and
domestic users.
Statutory water management committees and customary leaders such as
elders are
involved in preventing and mitigating conflicts. Men and women
perceived women to
have unique knowledge that would improve water management. Cultural
norms made it
difficult for women to participate in decision making on the water
management
committees, however women were involved in water management through
initiatives that
increased access to domestic water.
Discussion: Community experiences with water conflict suggest
that the overlapping role
of statutory water management committees and customary leaders
leads to confusion
about the mandate of each in addressing water conflicts. It appears
that women have
little decision making power on water management committees in this
cultural context,
but women's initiatives to separate domestic water collection from
livestock collection
points reduced the potential for water conflicts and were
culturally appropriate. Evidence
from this project can be used to promote culturally appropriate
ways to involve women in
water management that reduce conflicts and increase access to
domestic water supplies.","Table of Contents -- INTRODUCTION

urban trauma population","Exposure to childhood abuse is associated with increased risk
for psychopathology as an adult. Victims of childhood abuse,
however, may also present as resilient. Resilience is defined as
competent social functioning following a traumatic event, as well
as the absence of psychopathology. Research is vague as to why
victims develop resilient or psychopathological patterns of
behavior following traumatic events, and what lifestyle or
neurological correlates contribute to either. Adult participants
were recruited as part of a larger NIMH-funded study of
trauma-related risk and resilience in a highly traumatized sample
arriving for care in an urban public hospital. Childhood abuse
history was assessed from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.
Inner-emotional components of resilience (proximal resilience) were
determined from the Emotional Dysregulation Scale, a subscale of
the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale and the positive
component of the Positive and Negative Adjective Scale.
Social/environmental (distal resilience) components were assessed
from the Life-Base Interview and from the Clinical Data Form. A
modified dot-probe task examined differences between proximal and
distal resilience as predictor of attention bias for happy and
threatening human facial stimuli. Results show participants who
self-report the most severe childhood abuse history are more likely
to develop proximal resilience than distal resilience. Attention
biases for threatening or happy stimuli were not significant
predictors for proximal or distal resilience components in the
dot-probe task. These findings suggest that disparities within
resilience development directly relate to traumatic history. Future
research should focus on fostering specific components of
resilience to lessen psychopathological development.","Table of Contents -- Abstract -- Introduction 1 -- Biological

ABSTRACT 
Background: The burden of cardiovascular disease is
significant in women and men; however, the clinical presentation,
risk factors, and outcomes vary. Whether the pathophysiology of
ischemic heart disease has unique aspects in women and whether
there are risk factors that are specific for women, such as
reproductive factors, is unclear. The literature is conflicting on
whether early natural menopause is associated with premature
coronary heart disease in women. We hypothesize that young women
who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction have more often
undergone premature menopause than age-matched community-control
women, and that early menopause correlates with depression.
Methods:This is a case control study comparing age and
type of menopause between women who have suffered an early acute
myocardial infarction (prior to the age of 60) and age and race
matched controls. Cases include 49 women hospitalized at an
Emory-affiliated hospital enrolled in the ongoing MI and Mental
Stress (MIMS) study. Community controls were drawn from the
Meta-Health study, which drew women from the Atlanta metropolitan
area. Controls were matched by age (+/- 3 years) and race in a 2:1
ratio of controls to cases. 
Results:The case control study population was composed of
a total 147 women (49 cases and 98 controls) with mean age being 50
years old and 67.4% blacks. Cases were more likely to be current
smokers (58.3% vs. 17.4%), have a history of hypertension (71.4%
vs. 35.7%), a history of diabetes (20.4% vs. 7.1%), and a history
of dyslipidemia (73.5% vs. 36.7%). Cases also had a higher mean BDI
score (13.1 vs. 9.2). While 62.5% of cases and only 51.6% of
controls had reported having undergone menopause the difference
between the two groups was not statistically significant (p=
0.212). Menopausal status was not significantly associated with
early acute MI in bivariate analysis.
Conclusion: Neither menopausal status nor age underwent
menopause were significantly associated with early acute MI in
bivariate or multivariable models. However, we found that smoking,
history of dyslipidemia, and history of hypertension were
significant, independent risk factors associated with high risk for
early acute MI.","-- Introduction_________________________________________ 7 --

Method for Cross-Cultural Comparison in the US, Samoa and

process through which children become socialized to their culture
within a relatively controlled environment. In the preschool
setting, children are implicitly and explicitly instructed about
cultural norms and practices, and because of this, preschools
become microcosms of society. Cross-cultural psychologists have
long sought a means of quantifying differences between cultures,
but outside of qualitative interview analysis, little progress has
been made in the examination of culture at the childhood level.
Following the model of Tobin et al. (1989, 2009), a three-part
method for the observation and evaluation of cultural models of
preschool has been employed in the South Pacific. Though it appears
that preschools do not differ significantly when analyzed
quantitatively, it is believed that the addition of anecdotal
evidence helps to illuminate the presence and lack of certain
differences.","PRESCHOOL IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC -- Table of Contents --

published,emory:7tnfn,"Carlson, Marten Erik",Behind Open Doors: The Cinematic Spaces of the Slasher Film,"For many years, the slasher genre has been largely unappreciated by
film scholars.
The two authors who have dealt most with these films, Carol Clover
and Vera Dika,
leave much room for additional research. Clover and Dika base their
criticism on gender
and narrative, respectively and, while their theories apply well to
a select number of
films, many slashers are left unaccounted for. With this thesis, I
offer a model that
supplements the work of Clover and Dika.
Historical context is very important for an understanding of the
slasher. Though
this genre exists today in the form of remakes such as Friday
the 13th (Paramount, 2009)
and A Nightmare on Elm Street (New Line, 2010), these films
were never as popular as
they were between 1978 and 1982. Following the release of
Halloween (Compass) in
1978, variations of the slasher model filled American cinema
screens. To understand the
success of films such as The Prowler (Sandhurst, 1981),
The Burning (Filmmways,
1981), and The Dorm that Dripped Blood (New Image, 1982)
during a relatively short
time period, I analyze the socio-cultural milieu of the late 1970s
and early 1980s.
Looking at this five year period in American history, the state of
the American
nuclear family is truly striking. As scholars such as Natasha
Zaretsky and Christopher
Lasch discuss, the family unit was in great disarray during this
time period. Divorce rates
were at a new high, teen drug use was rising, and new abortion laws
came into effect
during the latter 1970s. These changes along with many others
contributed to a
weakening of parental authority.
These shifts in family structures are represented in the cinematic
spaces of the
slahser. In order to link the cinematic spaces with the history of
this time period, I draw
on Mikhail Bakhtin's ""chronotope."" Film scholars like Vivian
Sobchack employ the
chronotope in order to draw connections between real, lived
experience and cinematic
representation. Like Sobchack, I consider the chronotopes or
""time-spaces"" of the slasher
in order to comprehend the genre's pervasiveness during the late
1970s and early 1980s.","Table of Contents -- The ""Slasher""

King's Vision of the Beloved Community as a Model Christian
Response to
the Genocide in Darfur
By
Vernon Frazier, JD


In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG)
in response to the Holocaust which claimed over 6 million lives.
Since the conclusion of World War II and the United Nations
adoption of the CPPCG, the world witnessed genocides in Cambodia,
Bosnia, Rwanda and my topic of discussion, Darfur. In 2003, a
counter-insurgency conducted by the Sudanese
government and Janjaweed militia claimed over 300,000 lives and
displaced over
4 million people by 2007 in Darfur.
On July 14, 2008, the ICC indicted President al-Bashir of ten
counts for
sponsoring war crimes and crimes against humanity under the Rome
Statute
articles 7 (1), 8 (1) and 8 (f).1 Since the indictment, President
al-Bashir is still at
large and continues to commit atrocities against Darfuris with
impunity such as
dispelling 13 international humanitarian NGOs after the indictment
was
announced. It is my belief that the genocidal acts by the Sudanese
government
and Janjaweed militia between 2003 and 2007 are not isolated within
this
timeframe; however the consequences of the counter-insurgency have
created
conditions that have made the crisis in Darfur ongoing.
In his speech, Beyond Vietnam - A Time to Break Silence, Dr.
Martin Luther
King, Jr. utilized his moral vision, The Beloved Community,
to address the
atrocities committed
vision can be used
as moral ethical response to atrocities of the Darfur genocide as
well as offer
potential solutions for reconciliation. Human rights violations
such as the killing
of civilians, the deprivation of civil liberties of its citizens
that occurred in Darfur,
parallels to what existed in Vietnam and during the civil rights
movement in the
United States. In my thesis, I will discuss the following:
ï‚· The sources of scripture, tradition, theology,
politics, experience and
reason King used in formulating his moral vision, ""The
Beloved
Community.""
ï‚· How King's moral vision can be used to point
out the improprieties of the
genocide that occurred in Darfur
ï‚· If a Christian response is necessary in post
referendum Sudan, if so, can
King's moral vision be applicable in this situation.

biomaterials design","Site-specific incorporation of selective unnatural functional
groups into proteins has provided a means to expand the protein
diversity, creating proteins with unique chemical properties useful
for a broad range of new applications. However, the preparation of
protein polymers derived from the sequence-repetitive polypeptides
requires new development in which non-canonical amino acids are
incorporated at multiple and specific locations in the polypeptides
sequences. We describe herein a simple and efficient method to
facilitate the multi-site selective insertions of non-canonical
amino acids at structurally defined positions within recombinant
polypeptides and provide opportunities for engineering proteins
modified extensively with selected amino acid analogues. In this
approach, Escherichia coli MRA30, a bacterial host strain
with an attenuated activity of release factor 1 (RF1), was assessed
for its ability to support the incorporation of a diverse range of
non-canonical amino acids in response to multiple encoded amber
codons (UAG) within genes derived from superfolder GFP and
elastin-mimetic protein polymers. Suppression efficiency and
protein yield depended on the identity of the orthogonal
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/ tRNACUA pair and the
non-canonical amino acid. Elastin-mimetic protein polymers were
prepared where non-canonical amino acids were incorporated up to
twenty-two specific sites with high substitution efficiency. The
identities and positions of the variant residues were confirmed by
mass spectrometric analysis of the full-length polypeptides and the
proteolytic cleavage fragments from the thermolysin digestion.
Based on the developed system, we further demonstrate the
generation of novel amphiphilic elastin diblock copolymers that
could undergo temperature-dependent segregation and self-assemble
into core-shell-corona nanoparticles with photo-crosslinkable
activities. The photo-crosslinking experiments were monitored by
dynamic light scattering and microscopes. Our data suggest that
this multi-site suppression approach permits the preparation of
protein-based materials in which novel chemical functionality can
be introduced at precisely pre-defined positions within the
polypeptide sequence.","-- Multiple site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino

California Siblings in the CHARGE Study","Background
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) have a significant health
burden characterized by deficits in social skills and
communication, repetitive behaviors, and stereotyped body movements
usually beginning in early childhood. Short interpregnancy interval
(â‰¤ 12 months) has been associated with increased
risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) in previous birth-registry
studies of sibling pairs. These studies, however, had limited
ability to adjust for potential confounders.
Methods
ASDs were measured among California-born, singleton,
full-sibling pairs in the case-control CHARGE study. Trained
researchers collected information for index children's ASDs
diagnoses confounders using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-revised
(ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedules (ADOS).
They also used a variety of in-person and phone-based interviews to
collect information on potential confounders from the index
children's primary caregivers. General population controls were
selected from California birth files using stratified random
sampling. Interpregnancy interval was defined as the time between
the birth of a prior child and the conception of the index child in
a full sibship. It was calculated based off of information
collected from interviews with the primary caregiver of the index
child. The outcome of interest was ASDs in the index child. Odds
ratios were estimated by fitting logistic regression models.
Results

This study included 499 singleton, full sibling pairs born in
California, 265 cases and 234 controls. The OR for ASDs in the
index child comparing IPI â‰¤ 12 months adjusting
for mother's age at conception of the index child, race, education,
marital status, birthplace, desire to get pregnant, procedures used
to conceive the index child, prenatal vitamin use in the first
month of pregnancy of the index child, family home ownership,
child's gender and preterm birth was 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.6).
Conclusions
This analysis found increased odds of ASDs among births
â‰¤ 12 months apart, consistent with previous
studies. Due to the extensive data gathered by interviewing primary
caregivers, this study was able to control for a variety of
potential confounders that had not previously been examined.","Table of Contents --

Units","It seems no accident that a renewal of interest in the 1960s
avant-garde architectural group, Archigram, should erupt at this
historical moment. Communicated through drawings, photographs and
collage with an overarching pop sensibility and an often hollow
relation to reality, Archigram's vision of the city was based on
systems theory and imagined as an indeterminate kit of mobile,
autonomous parts. Their conception of the home was based on the
idea of a nomadic pod that would be invisibly linked to a
computerized network of servicing and communication. Although their
understanding of technology is often remembered as naïve,
their notion of the city as network and the home as interface
feels--and looks--familiar when seen from within today's
information-based culture. Although the genesis of the idea of
digital, information space arguably began as early as the 1960s, it
was not until the 1990s that Internet technology was made largely
accessible to the general public. So when scholars began to
reconsider Archigram's ideas, such as Peter Cook's Plug-In City and
Dennis Crompton's Computer City, it was within the context of the
popularization of a new medium that would radically change our
ideas of spatial habitation. The temporal correspondence of
Archigram's revival and the emergence of the most significant
technological development of our age points toward the importance
of an understanding of the group's radical and unsettling designs.
At this moment in the history of technology, it seems we are poised
to reconsider Archigram's work with new insight.

While many scholars have found their seductive, extraordinary ideas
about the city to be their most interesting and fertile
contribution to architectural history, this essay focuses on their
ideas of the home. It attempts to show how Archigram translated
their notions of a living city into a formal arrangement-that is,
the Plug-In City concept. It then explores the lineage of the
individual living units, which were initially designed as
components of the Plug-In kit-of-parts. Finally, it attempts to
demonstrate how these home units gradually disconnected from their
material contexts and increasingly came to rely on the idea of a
network of ""wireless"" communication.","I.

Population at Risk, Behavioral Response, and Fecal Contamination","Purpose: As the world becomes more urbanized, there is an
increased risk of exposure to natural hazards such as flooding due
to impervious surface areas without adequate parallel increases in
the number of drainage networks. Flooding may also increase an
individual's risk of exposure to fecal contamination containing an
enteric pathogen. This study was performed to gather data to
identify how many people in urban neighborhoods of Accra are at
risk for exposure to flooding, why the flooding occurs, document
the behaviors that could cause exposure to floodwater, and
determine whether people living in a flood zone are at risk for
exposure to increased fecal contamination.
Methods: Four different data collection procedures were
used: 1) GIS mapping of flood areas, 2) Calculating the population
at risk in each community by using census boundaries, 3) Household
questionnaire on behavioral practices in response to flooding, and
4) Microbiological testing of water and soil samples for general
E. coli and enteric viruses that indicate human fecal
contamination. 
Results:The percentage of area that flooded in Alajo,
Bukom, Old Fadama, and Shiabu were 28.98%, 33.02%, 87.36%, and
48.51%, respectively. Soil, drain, and floodwater samples had high
concentrations of E. coli and only a few detected norovirus
contamination. In a linear regression model for E. coli
concentration of soil samples both the community Old Fadama and
distance to the latrine were significant. For Old Fadama the
E. coli concentration increased by 4.8*103 CFU
per gram and within 20 meters of a latrine it increased by
8.5*105 CFU per gram of soil.
Discussion: A resident's contact to drain water is more
likely to be sporadic compared to floodwater where exposure is
almost guaranteed. There are potential risk factors such as
distance to a latrine and differences between communities, which
influence the amount of fecal contamination. However, a resident's
behavioral response to flooding can put them at an increased or
decreased risk for E. coli or norovirus exposure. Short-term
preventive factors such as bucketing out water during flooding
could potentially increase the risk of exposure to
fecal-contaminated floodwater compared to long-term preventive
factors such as cement walls.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Introduction- 1 -- Chapter 2:

published,emory:br07t,"Chen, Justin Han",Vehicular Air Pollutants and Noise in Atlanta Commuting,"Drivers in the United States are exposed to high concentrations of
air pollutants and
noise during commutes. Numerous negative health outcomes,
especially in
cardiovascular health, have been linked to both forms of exposure.
Noise may be
acting as a confounder in assessing the relationship between
traffic pollution and
acute adverse cardiovascular health outcomes. This study was
performed in order to
quantitatively examine the associations between in-vehicle noise
and several traffic
pollutants in multiple roadway microenvironments. Sampling was
conducted in 3
different sampling scenarios: 1) within a stationary outdoor
setting; 2) within an in-
vehicle stationary setting; and 3) within a moving in-vehicle
setting. This was done in
order to differentiate the effect the personally driven vehicle had
upon both noise
and air pollutant exposure. During the in-vehicle sampling
scenarios, ventilation and
window status were accounted for. Air pollutants measured were
particulate matter
2.5 mass (PM2.5), ultrafine particulate matter (UFPM), black carbon
(BC), and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Noise levels were measured
concurrently
with air pollutants. Resulting correlation coefficients between
measured air
pollutants and noise varied upon sampling scenario. The stationary
outdoor
sampling scenario exhibited the lowest values compared to the two
in-vehicle
sampling scenarios, with the stationary in-vehicle scenario showing
the greatest
correlation values for PM2.5 and BC, and the moving in-vehicle
scenario showing the
greatest values for UFPM and PAH. Strengths of association ranged
from moderately
strong (RS &gt; 0.60) to weak. Vehicle ventilation status had a
mixed effect upon
pollutant-noise correlations, but the stationary in-vehicle setting
generally showed a
more pronounced effect compared to the moving in-vehicle sampling
scenario.
Vehicular speed as a modifier of the linear relationship between
measured air
pollutants and noise exposure was also examined, and it was found
that UFPM and
BC may infiltrate the vehicle cabin with greater efficiency at
higher speeds. The
results of the regression analysis found similar results as the
calculated correlation
values, and time lagged pollutant exposures generally had a
weakening effect upon
associations. Noise acting as a confounder or effect modifier of
vehicular air
pollution is possible depending upon numerous variables, including
air pollutant type
and the exposure setting.","Table of Contents -- 1. Introduction pg. 1 -- 2. Materials and

(TB) and Post-exposure Compliance with Therapy for Latent TB
Infection Among Healthcare Workers Working in A Tertiary Care
Hospital in Saudi Arabia","Background: Controlling tuberculosis (TB) among
occupationally exposed
healthcare workers (HCWs) is challenged by limited
documentation of pre-
employment tuberculin skin test (TST) screening and the lack
of clinical
evaluation and completion of therapy for latent TB infection
(LTBI) after
occupational TB exposure. Methods: We retrospectively
reviewed occupational
TB exposures between 2008 and 2010 in King Abdulaziz Medical
City, Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia. We abstracted records and collected predictor
data for
documenting pre-employment TST status and subsequent TST
screening and
treatment for LTBI among occupationally exposed HCWs.
Results: We found 13
occupational TB exposure events involving 298 HCWs. Exposed
HCWs tend to
be female (70.6%), non-Saudi (76.9%), nurse (55.7%) or
respiratory therapist
(19.5%), working in critical care locations (72.8%).
Pre-employment TST
documentation existed for only 123 out of 298 (41.3%) exposed
HCWs. Among
those with documented baseline TST, 63 (51.2%) were TST
positive (21.1% of all
298 HCWs). After exposure, 53 (17.8%) of 298 exposed HCWs
were newly
diagnosed with LTBI and 49 (92.5%) of them were prescribed
therapy for LTBI.
Among those prescribed, 46 (93.9%) started therapy for LBTI
with the majority
(82.6%) did not finish the recommended course of therapy.
Conclusions: We
found low rates of pre-employment TST documentation among
exposed HCWs in
a large tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia and low
treatment compliance rate.","Introduction..........pg 1 -- Literature review....pg 6 --

Auglaize County, Ohio, 2004","The incidence of recreational water-associated outbreaks in
the United States has significantly increased since national
surveillance began in 1978. This increase has been driven by
outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium and associated with
treated recreational water venues (e.g., pools). On August 9, 2004,
Auglaize County Health Department staff detected several
laboratory-confirmed cases of diarrhea caused by
Cryptosporidium in a three-county area. Epidemiologic,
laboratory, and environmental health methods were used to
investigate the outbreak. While the outbreak was investigated and
prior to final results being available, proactive prevention
measures such as closure and hyperchlorination of pools and a
community-wide education campaign were undertaken. The matched
case-control study found that cryptosporidiosis was significantly
associated with swimming in Pool A (matched odds ratio [mOR] 121.7,
95% confidence interval [CI] 27.4-âˆž) as were
swimming, wading, or entering any swimming pool and swimming in or
entering recreational water. Twenty-eight of 45 (62.2%) stool
specimens tested were positive for Cryptosporidium by direct
immunofluorescent assay and molecular typing of 18 isolates
identified Cryptosporidium hominis, subtype IdA15G1. Samples
taken from the deep and shallow ends of Pool A were positive for
Cryptosporidium spp. by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
This report records the first detection of Cryptosporidium
hominis, subtype IdA15G1 in the United States. The results of
the combined methods of this investigation indicate that Pool A was
the cause of the outbreak. The findings also suggest a proactive
public health response when increased Cryptosporidium
transmission is detected and before an outbreak source is
epidemiologically implicated might prevent a focal
cryptosporidiosis outbreak from evolving into a community-wide
outbreak.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I -- Literature

published,emory:19mqd,"Aubert, Rachael D","Interplay between T and B cell responses during chronic viral
infection","The adaptive immune response has evolved multiple mechanisms for
protection against invading pathogens. CD8 T cells mediate
protection against intracellular pathogens by killing infected
cells, whereas the B cell response provides antibody that can
neutralize foreign pathogens. Additionally, CD4 T cell responses
are important for activating CD8 T cell and B cell responses.
Although the importance of CD4 T cells in initiating B cell
responses is well established, less is understood about how CD4 T
cells initiate or sustain CD8 T cell responses. This question
becomes increasingly important as we try to understand why CD8 T
cell responses fail during chronic viral infections such as HIV,
HBV and HCV. In these infections, a poor CD4 T cell response is
often associated with functional exhaustion of the CD8 T cells. To
better understand the interplay between CD4 T cell responses and
CD8 T cell exhaustion, we examined the effects of altering CD4 T
cell and B cell responses during chronic LCMV infection of mice. We
first examined the question of how transient removal of CD4 T cell
help affects long-term CD8 T cell responses. Secondly, we
determined whether improving CD4 T cell help would affect CD8 T
cell exhaustion. A transient one-week blockade of CD4 T cell help
via administration of αCD40L blocking antibody beginning at
two weeks post infection had no direct effect on the function of
CD8 T cells but resulted in reduced CD4 T cell function and
decreased levels of humoral immunity. This decreased CD4 T cell
response then resulted in greater CD8 T cell exhaustion and
impaired viral clearance. On the other hand, adoptive transfer of
virus specific CD4 T cells during chronic LCMV infection restored
function in exhausted CD8 T cells and also enhanced antibody
responses. This rescue was observed for several CD8 T cell
epitopes, was synergized by αPD-L1 treatment, and resulted in
improved viral control in treated animals. Thus, these studies
provide insights into how CD4 T cells and B cells can affect CD8 T
cell programming and how one might design therapies to combat
chronic infections in humans.","Table of Contents -- Table of Contents -- List of Figures -- Table

Disparities Between Five Sudanese States","Objective: To determine the differences in the prevalence
and leading causes of
bilateral blindness and visual impairment, barriers to cataract
surgery, and cataract
surgical coverage between Kassala, Northern, North Kordofan,
Sennar, and White
Nile states in Sudan.
Methods: The Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB)
survey
methodology, a multistage cluster sampling design, was utilized to
gather data on
visual acuity, causes of vision loss, reasons for untreated
cataract, and details about
past cataract surgeries. Data were analyzed using SAS-Callable
SUDAAN.
Results: A total of 10,499 eligible subjects were included
in the analysis, and 550
suffered from bilateral vision loss. The prevalence of bilateral
blindness ranged from
6.34 cases per 1,000 people in the Northern state to 13.10 cases
per 1,000 people in
Kassala. Cataract was the leading cause of all levels of vision
loss in each state, and
more than 80% of blindness and 85% of vision loss could have been
avoided. Cost
was the most popularly reported barrier to cataract surgery. Other
important
barriers included absence of surgical services, no knowledge of
treatment, and
awaiting cataract maturity. Cataract surgical coverage rates were
moderate in each
state, the lowest in Kassala and the highest in the Northern state.
IOL implant
surgery was most widely performed. Most cataract surgeries were
performed in
government hospitals, and eye camps and improvised settings were
significantly
more likely to provide surgical services free of charge. Patient
satisfaction was
significantly correlated with the type of surgery received.
Conclusions: Further efforts are needed in Sudan to help
reach the goal of the
VISION 2020 initiative to eliminate all avoidable global blindness.
Based on the
barriers to cataract surgery, educational efforts should target
visually impaired
groups to increase knowledge of treatment options and access to
surgical services.
Hospitals should work closely with community ophthalmology
organizations to
offer and promote discounted surgical services. Finally, to prevent
further
disparities between cataract surgery qualities, traditional surgery
settings and
couching practices should be the target of future
interventions.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

restructuring occurred within
the context of a simultaneous investment in neighborhood
revitalization; (2)
external, non-school stakeholders with varied primary goals
initiated and invested in
restructuring because they viewed a high-performing school as
critically important yet
secondary, a tool needed to supported their primary motivations;
(3) restructuring
resulted in dramatic increases in student achievement for
low-income, African America children,

(4) committed school-

not the result of poverty as a deficit of individuals but rather
were the result of a legacy of social

Tradeoff","Abstract
Central Bank Regulation: A Financial and Macroeconomic Tradeoff

As a result of the devastation from the 2008 global crisis, many
nations have enacted financial regulatory reforms in an attempt to
increase stringency in bank supervision. In response to this wave
of new laws, widespread debate has emerged on whether banks are too
constrained or if the reforms are not demanding enough. However,
the stringency of regulations is contingent upon the level of
enforcement used by regulators. Examining relationships between
domestic regulatory structures and financial regulatory quality can
help shed insight into what type of regulators are more risk-averse
and likely to strictly supervise banks. Thus, regardless of the
actual stringency of new regulations, the only way they will have
traction when implemented is if the financial regulator is capable
or willing to effectively enforce them.
Recent research indicates that placing regulatory authority
outside of the central bank
correlates with less inflation, because the central bank can solely
focus on price stability when deciding the interest rate
(Copelovitch and Singer, 2008). Regulatory central banks have
additional concerns about financial sector health when deciding
monetary policy, swaying them to implement relatively lower
interest rates because higher rates are more costly for their
banks. As a result, the lower interest rates cause more inflation
in the domestic economy. This conclusion does not stipulate that
the regulatory authority outside of the central bank will supervise
with similar stringency, but increased bank instability could still
create vulnerabilities
for the economy.
In this thesis, I argue that regulatory central banks have a
higher standard for stability than separate regulatory agencies
because of the central bank's additional macroeconomic concerns.
The results of my analysis indicate that banks supervised by
central banks have higher capital ratios and a smaller chance of
insolvency, making the regulatory regimes into a tradeoff:
regulatory central banks may set lower interest rates, but they are
more stringent in regulating financial firms.","Table of Contents --

Expanding the Window of Opportunity: Intransal Delivery of Wnt 3a
and Whisker
Stimulation in the Ischemic Stroke Mouse Model

Each year, one out of six individuals will suffer a stroke. Despite
extensive basic and clinical
investigations, stroke remains to be the leading threat to human
life and health in the US and
worldwide. Up to now, there are very few effective treatments for
acute stroke patients. Novel
neuroprotective therapy and regenerative therapy are urgently
needed for clinical applications.
The purpose of this investigation was to test a combination therapy
of a canonical Wnt signaling
protein involved in neurodevelopment, Wnt 3a and whisker
stimulation in the enhancement of
neurogenesis and angiogenesis following focal ischemic stroke in
Nestin-GFP mice. In an
ischemic barrel cortex stroke mouse model induced by ligations of
distal branches of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) in Nestin-GFP mice, Wnt 3a was administrated
intranasally to stimulate
the Wnt signaling pathway while peripheral whisker stimulation was
applied as a central specific
rehabilitation treatment after stroke. The combination therapy
showed increased expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) in the
penumbra region 14 days after stroke. Co-labeling of
5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and NeuN
positive cells in the penumbra demonstrated augmented neurogenesis,
while increased co-
labeling of BrdU and Collagen IV suggested increased angiogenesis
in these mice. Wnt 3a paired
with whisker stimulation also increased local blood flow compared
to the saline control. In
addition, the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 expression increased when Wnt 3a
was paired with
peripheral stimulation, suggesting enhanced sensitivity to
chemoattractant directed migration that
may promote homing of neuroblasts from the subventricular zone to
the infarct site. Cellular
migration was confirmed with positive Doublecortin (DCX) and BrdU
co-labeling.
These data support that the combination therapy targeting the
Wnt pathway paired with peripheral signals
may be beneficial for long-term tissue repair and functional
recovery after ischemic stroke.","Table of Contents --

Prenatal Exposure to Maternal Distress and Child Behavior During
the Preschool Years
This study investigated the relationship between prenatal maternal
distress and preschool
children's internalizing and externalizing problems. This study
also evaluated potential
mediating (stress reactivity) and moderating (postnatal stress
exposure) factors related to this
process, thereby adding to the literature a clearer picture of the
risk pathway associated with
prenatal maternal distress exposure. During a lab visit, 74
preschool aged children were exposed
to two consecutive stressor tasks, and baseline and post-stressor
cortisol levels were analyzed in
order to investigate HPA axis dysregulation. Child behavior was
measured using a standardized
assessment and was completed by both the mother and an alternate
caregiver in order to reduce
the impact of maternal bias on the results. Results revealed that
prenatal maternal distress
exposure was associated with HPA axis dysregulation in this sample
and that child cortisol
reactivity mediated the relationship between prenatal maternal
distress and externalizing
problems in childhood. Specifically, cortisol reactivity assumed a
key role in the development of
aggressive behavior in childhood; however, it did not mediate the
relationship between prenatal
maternal distress and child attention problems. Moreover, results
suggested a moderating effect
of current maternal stress on the relationship between child
cortisol reactivity and behavior
problems. Results indicated that greater levels of cortisol
reactivity are more likely to be
associated with higher levels of behavioral problems in children if
the child is exposed to recent
stressful life events. An interpretation of these findings and
implications for clinical practice are
addressed.","Introduction………………………………………………………………………………............………..1

assess the functional role of V1a receptor diversity","ABSTRACT
Understanding the biological mechanisms regulating individual
and species differences in behavior has implications for both
evolutionary biology and human mental health. The vasopressin V1a
receptor (V1aR) system provides an ideal model for exploring the
relationship between genetic sequence diversity, protein
expression, and behavioral variation. Activation of V1aR modulates
a wide array of behaviors including social memory, anxiety, and
many species-specific affiliative and aggressive behaviors. In both
humans and rodents, diversity in these behaviors is hypothesized to
result from polymorphic repetitive DNA elements located upstream of
the V1a receptor gene (AVPR1A). These elements are
thought to influence gene expression, thereby altering neural V1aR
expression patterns. However, despite significant interest in this
system, there remain a number of unanswered questions, and studies
to date have not been able to establish causality with respect to
AVPR1A genetic diversity, V1aR expression, and behavior. Therefore,
the goal of this dissertation is to establish various models that
will allow us to directly investigate the V1aR gene-brain-behavior
relationship. In order to do so, I first explore evolution and
novel genetic diversity within the primate AVPR1A locus. I then
establish genetically modified rodent models which will be used to
explore the causal relationship between genetic diversity, protein
expression, and social behavior. Specifically, within three
congenic mouse lines, the relationship between genetic
polymorphsims and V1aR expression will be directly examined through
targeted introduction of variable repetitive elements upstream of
the avpr1a transcription start site. In voles, I
establish transgenic and RNAi technologies to generate voles with
reduced V1aR expression which will be used to directly investigate
the behavioral role of V1aR and V1aR variability. These varied
models will build on previous correlational studies and lay the
foundation for understanding the role of genetic and protein
diversity in determining individual and species differences in
behavior.","-- TABLE OF CONTENTS

published,emory:bsb5n,"Kathuria, Abhishek","Janus Rising: Information Technology Role in Facilitation of
Organizational Ambidexterity and Identity","Information Technology (IT) permits new organizational
possibilities - tolerating and
thriving in complex organizational settings that result from the
election of conflicting strategic
objectives. As a critical resource in today's knowledge-driven,
hypercompetitive environment, IT
accrues several indirect benefits through intermediate
value-creating organizational processes.
Tolerating strategic tensions generated by competing demands on
organizational attention and
resources is one such process. The quest to attain competitive
advantage through the concurrent
pursuit of seemingly conflicting strategies or identities is a
major source of these tensions. This
dissertation examines the role of information systems in
facilitating organizational ambidexterity and
managing multiple organizational identities. In the first
component, I selected to gather data from
352 manufacturing firms in high growth sectors in India - a novel
empirical setting which provides an
exemplar for the world's enterprises undergoing rapid structural
changes in the 21st century. I find
strong support for my assertion that an organization's IT resources
and capabilities facilitate
organizational ambidexterity, hitherto a challenging competitive
possibility. In the second
component, I examine the role of IT in enhancing post-acquisition
integration of externally acquired
explorative or exploitative innovation. I extend March's
Exploration-Exploitation model in the
context of acquisitions by introducing IT-enabled learning
mechanisms. I offer theoretical
propositions and find that post-acquisition integration strategies
and IT-enabled learning
mechanisms have different, but complementary impacts. In the third
component of this dissertation
research, I assert a causal model of IT capability in the
management of multiple identities. I then
develop a computer simulation model and find that an organization's
IT capability leads to highest
performance increases under conditions of low identity plurality,
low identity synergy and low IT
capability. Overall, I show that IT enables the management of
seemingly paradoxical challenges that
arise in the tolerance of the complexity inherent in effectively
resolving strategic tensions. The
results from this dissertation contribute towards a theory of
IT-enabled management of strategic
tensions and inform our understanding of the complex relationships
and theoretical pathways from
IT to competitive advantage. I validate the viability of IT-enabled
organizational ambidexterity and
IT-enabled management of multiple identities as competitive
possibilities emergent in the 21st
century.","Table of Contents -- 1 Introduction

Now is the Time of Youth: Youth, Nationalism and Cultural Change in
Ghana,
1940-1966
By Jeremy Pool
This dissertation asks why youth became the focus of
nation-building efforts
for both colonial and nationalist governments and explores the
implications of state
policy on youth for Ghana's political culture. My approach blends
political and cultural
history to write about national
formation across the divide of independence. I examine the fields
of education, social
welfare and ideological training in order to understand how
state-policy and youth
activism made youth central to Ghana's imagination of
nationhood.
The Introduction relates the dissertation to three bodies of
literature: studies of
nationalism, studies of Africa's colonial and post-colonial states,
and studies of youth by
historians and social scientists, particularly in Africa. Chapter
One examines colonial
and early nationalist policy on education as an aspect of changing
approaches to
governance. Colonial officials expected an expanded education
system to produce a new
colonial citizenry. The Convention People's Party (CPP) embraced
education as a path to
economic development, political stabilization and cultural
modernity. Chapter Two
looks at the failure of colonial models of education to contain
students' discontent and at
their embrace of nationalist politics. I undertake a
micro-historical study of a set of
school strikes at three boys' secondary schools following the 1948
riots and explore their
significance for changes in political consciousness in the
nationalist period. Chapter
Three shifts attention to the field of criminality and social
welfare and considers the
threat that delinquent or unemployed youth could pose to social
order and national
development. It analyzes colonial and nationalist efforts to
understand and transform
these social problems. Chapter Four considers the project of
ideological training in
Ghana. Against the background of colonial efforts, I examine the
CPP's Young Pioneers
Movement and its efforts to establish itself as Ghana's official
youth organization. I
consider youths' public performance of the nation and tensions
within families as youth
were asked to make loyalty to the state primary. The conclusion
summarizes the
preceding materials and reflects on their significance for our
understanding of nationhood
and the nationalist period in Africa.","Table of Contents -- Introduction: Youth and Nation Building in

published,emory:fzpp6,"Ludin, Tessa Marie","sex, lies, (drugs, violence, neglect, angst, suicide) and
videotape: Defining the Contemporary Delinquent Film Cycle","This thesis attempts to define the contemporary (1990-present)
juvenile delinquent film cycle. The delinquent film is a subgenre
of the broader teen film genre and has often been connected most
strongly to films of the 1950s. Films with delinquent film
qualities and characteristics were made before and have been made
since, and this thesis uses cyclical analysis to differentiate
between and define JD trends throughout history. This broadens the
scope of the delinquent film as a subgeneric category and allows
for comparisons across time.
The first chapter uses information from the Motion Picture
Production Code and its files on specific JD films to help make
sense of the trend in the subgenre to reclaim and reinstitute order
in the film's resolution. My argument is that, rather than seeing
this as a decision made by the filmmakers, this is much more an
outcome of the rules and regulations of the Code. We see this trend
persist beyond the dismantling of the Production Code, and with
that, I argue the second cycle emerges. Choosing to follow the
films of the 1950s and 1960s faithfully, the films of the second
cycle both end with the reinstitution of order as well as adopt a
period-film setting in order to aesthetically mimic the earlier
films. The thesis argues that this faithfulness actually acts in
contradiction to the essence of the films of the first cycle,
shifting the subgenre from the realm of the social problem film to
a coming of age narrative. The third cycle emerges as a result of
the boom in independent cinema of the late 1980s, and allows the
subgenre to return to the volatility of the present while radically
rethinking narrative and aesthetic motifs of the subgenre. The
second chapter explores the second cycle in depth, comparing
thirty-five contemporary delinquent films in order to examine their
commonalities. The third chapter, through examining film reviews,
box office statistics, MPAA ratings, and notions of the festival
art film, looks to simultaneously use and question traditional
concepts of film genre.","Introduction - 1 -- Chapter 1: History of the Subgenre - 6 --

Maternal Depression, Marital Satisfaction, and Internalizing
Behaviors at Age 20
By Christine Hannah Wang
This study examined the separate and combined effects of maternal
depression and low marital
satisfaction on young adult's internalizing problems. We also
examined whether youth social
functioning, attachment style, parent-child relationship, and
self-esteem measured during
adolescence would serve as potential mediators of these effects.
The sample included 749
Australian mothers and their children who had been followed since
pregnancy. The sample was
predominantly white and lower/middle SES. Results indicated that
maternal depression and
marital satisfaction had both separate and combined effects on
youth internalizing behaviors.
Importantly maternal depression was more strongly associated with
internalizing behavior
outcomes in those youth whose parents also reported low levels of
marital satisfaction. While
maternal depression was related to mother psychological control,
secure attachment, fearful
attachment, and self-esteem and low marital satisfaction was
related to father psychological
control, none of these factors explained the effects of maternal
depression and low marital
satisfaction on young adult outcomes. The findings are discussed in
relation to developmental
theory and as they might pertain to preventative interventions with
high risk youth.","Table of Contents -- Cover Page ...1 -- Abstract ...2 --

published,emory:93ppb,"Schwei, Rebecca ","Adapting Preschool Food and Nutrition Lessons for New Immigrant
Children","Introduction: Inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption
in preschoolers is a public
health concern because eating patterns developed early in life
track into adulthood. New
immigrant families and children are especially at risk of low fruit
and vegetable
consumption as a result of lower familiarity with foods found in
the United States and
limited English proficiency. This project adapts experiential
preschool food and nutrition
lessons to be used for new immigrant preschoolers and their
mothers.
Methods: New immigrant mothers and preschoolers (n = 26)
participated in lessons
designed to help children experience and learn about healthy foods.
The lessons included
five general sections: story, exercise, classroom activity, hand
washing and taste test.
Observational data were used to measure acceptability of lessons
and reactions to taste
test. Pre/post-test assessments assessed changes in knowledge,
attitudes and behaviors of
preschool children relating to fruits and vegetables.
Results: Effective teaching strategies including repetition
and active participation
engaged mothers and children in lesson activities and subsequent
teaching concepts such
as fruit and vegetable identification. Preschool
childrenâ€Ÿs reactions to food ranged from
very positive to unwillingness to participate. The
mothersâ€Ÿ reactions to the taste tests also
ranged from positive to no participation. As expected, only limited
changes in
preschoolersâ€Ÿ knowledge, attitudes and behaviors
were observed.
Discussion: Certain sections of the food and nutrition
lessons, such as the story, were
more difficult to adapt for English Language Learners (ELLs) as
compared to the taste
tests, which were immediately engaging. Communication issues with
preschool staff, the
language barrier and lesser familiarity with a formal educational
setting were challenges
that affected the effectiveness of the food and nutrition lessons.
With increased exposure
to taste tests preschool children became more comfortable working
with food and more
comfortable with the researcher. This research provides an example
of the process of
adapting food and nutrition lessons and highlights successful
teaching strategies for
ELLs. This project will provide community organizations with the
resources to help new
immigrant families adopt healthy diets in the United
States.","Preamble -- Chapter 1: Introduction

published,emory:dw0jd,"Machen, Alexandra Jay","Factors Associated with Illicit Drug Use among Male Prisoners
Before, During, and Following Incarceration in the Mexico City
Prison System","Background: In Mexico, illegal drug use is a public
health problem. Some of the principal risk factors associated with
drug use include high rates of unemployment, low educational
levels, dysfunctional families, and psychological and psychiatric
problems. Prison populations have higher rates of illegal drug use
than the general population.
Methods: In 2009, a random sample of
3,500 male inmates 18 years or older was given the
self-administered questionnaire. 2,279 prisoners
completed questions concerning drug use and potential risk factors
associated with drug use included age, education, risk
of depression, intelligence, employment prior to incarceration, and
children. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were conducted to
create three separate models to assess the
changing risk factors associated with drug
use before arrest, during incarceration, and following
incarceration. 
Results: Prior to arrest, prisoners
with a risk of severe depression (aOR=1.45, 95%CI=1.07-1.96,
p=0.0.0164) compared with moderate depression, and below average
intelligence (aOR=1.59, 95%CI=1.02-2.48, p=0.0400)compared with
definitely above average intelligence were significantly more
likely to report drug use. Prisoners who were previously employed
(aOR 0.45, 95%CI=0.25-0.82, p=0.0096) compared to not employed, had
children (aOR=0.50, 95%CI=0.35-0.71, p=0.0001) compared with no
children, and completed secondary school (aOR=0.56,
95%CI=0.38-0.84, p=0.0053) compared with preparatory school or more
were less likely to use drugs prior to arrest. During
incarceration, prisoners with a risk of severe depression
(aOR=1.43, 95%CI=1.18-1.73, p=0.0003) compared with moderate
depression were significantly more likely to report drug use, and
prisoners age 35 to 44(aOR= 0.72, 95%CI=0.560-0.928, p=0.0111)
compared to prisoners age 25 to 34, were less likely to use drugs.
Following incarceration, prisoners with a risk of severe depression
(aOR=1.59, 95%CI=1.15-2.19, p=0.0048 compared with moderate
depression were significantly more likely to report high
probability of drug use, while prisoners that had children (aOR=
0.634, 95%CI=0.460-0,873, p=0.0053) compared to prisoners that did
not have children, were less likely to report high
probability.
Conclusions: Information on drug use
and risk factors associated with drug use among male prisoners in
Mexico City's prisons can be used to tailor interventions to
prevent and reduce drug use during and following
incarceration.","-- Background

published,emory:gsk7s,"Claiborne, Daniel","New Insight into Host and Viral Factors that Influence HIV-1
Pathogenesis","Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), the etiologic agent
of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), was responsible for
1.6 million deaths in 2012, and there are over 35 million people
worldwide currently living with HIV. HIV is a life-long, chronic
viral infection characterized by a steady decline in CD4+ T cells
resulting in a state of overt immunodeficiency. Despite the fact
that a majority of HIV-1 infected individuals eventually progress
to AIDS, they do so at varying rates, implying that host or viral
factors may alter the trajectory of disease. Here, we study acute
HIV-1 infection in a cohort of Zambian volunteers in order to
define the complex interplay between transmitted viral
characteristics and the host immune response and their influence on
HIV-1 pathogenesis.
Here, we demonstrate that viral replicative capacity (vRC), as
defined by the viral Gag protein, has a dramatic impact on HIV-1
disease progression, in that high vRC is associated with elevated
plasma viral loads and accelerated loss of CD4+ T cells.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that vRC drives multiple facets of
HIV-1 immunopathology. High vRC initiates an exacerbated
inflammatory state characterized by increased levels of
inflammatory cytokines, aberrant T cell activation phenotypes, and
increased infection of central memory CD4+ T cells.
Events dictated by vRC can be further modulated by the host's
cellular immune response. In this same cohort we identify novel
immunogenetic factors associated with significant protection from
CD4+ T cell decline. Interestingly, these alleles exert a
protective effect without significantly controlling plasma viral
load, suggesting an alternate mechanism. Indeed, we find that in
the earliest stages of infection, these protective immunogenetic
factors are associated with reduced markers of gut damage and
microbial translocation, which are known to contribute to chronic
immune activation in HIV infection.
These data expand our current knowledge of the viral and host
characteristics that influence the trajectory of HIV-1 pathogenesis
and specifically highlight the importance of early events post
transmission, which dramatically impact the course of disease.
Furthermore, these results suggest that vaccine-induced immune
responses or interventional therapeutics capable of attenuating
early viral replication may have a significant, long-term benefit
for the host.",

Secular Muslims and the Tapestry of Islamicate Secularity:
The Strands of a Contested Tradition
By Isaac Payne
This thesis inquires into Muslim perceptions and conceptions of
political secularism in
both Western and non-European societies. This study begins with an
investigation of secularity
in its Western context by writing about the philosophical,
sociological, and political aspects of
secularism; second, it surveys the case study of Egypt and Egyptian
Sunni Muslim formations of
political secularism in the 19th-21st centuries, highlighting the
important themes of this debate
that occur beyond strictly European experiences; third, it examines
the writings of Tariq
Ramadan and Yusuf al-Qaradawi and explains the most evident, though
not the exclusive,
characteristics and typologies of secular Muslims and Muslim views
of political secularism.
This research asks several distinct questions that I address
throughout my thesis. First,
given the common references to ""secular Islam"" and ""secular
Muslims"" in contemporary media
sources, I ask: what does it mean to be a secular Muslim? And,
similarly, what does being
secular imply for how the individual and society define Islam and
the role of Islam in that
society?
My conclusions based on my research are that in examining the
contested issues among
political secularists and Islam, one must account for a diverse
spectrum of topics that differ from
Western discourses on secularism; namely, one must reflect on how
these individuals view the
shari'a, the state, positive law, and the nexus among these
in regards to both a ""public vision"" of
Islam and a secular Weltanschauung. I submit that Muslim
conceptions of political secularism
include (not exhaustively): the, at least, partial separation of
Islam from the functions of the
state and the larger political sphere, the marginalization,
though not complete separation, of the
shari'a from the legal structure and legal culture of a
secularizing society, the rejection of a
""hard"" comprehensive Islam ( islam shamil) as formulated by
some ""Islamists,"" and the
association of secularism with a rational, autonomous, and
universal mind-set.","Table of Contents -- Preface: Reflections on Islam in the Maghrib

Part II: Comparison of Paclitaxel Analogs through Molecular
Dynamics Simulation; Solution Conformations of Cyclic Peptides","Part I:
The NMDA receptor is an ionotropic glutamate receptor found
throughout the CNS.
The receptor functions as a tetramer comprised of two NR1 subunits
and two NR2
subunits. There are four subtypes of NR2, NR2A through NR2D, and
functional
properties of the assembled receptor vary with the identity of the
NR2 subunits. The
ligand binding domain of this receptor binds either the agonist
glutamate or co-agonist
glycine, and triggers the gating process which allows ions to flow
through the channel.
Crystal structures of the ligand binding domain have recently been
solved, and these
structures provided the basis for molecular dynamics simulations of
ligand binding
domains of different NR2 subtypes. Structures of different NR2
ligand binding domains
were prepared by homology modeling, and simulations were performed
of just the NR2
ligand binding domain, as well as simulation of the ligand binding
domain dimer of
NR1/NR2. Comparison of simulations of different subtypes as well as
the same subtype
with different ligands bound reveal structural differences and
changes that may shed
light on how the receptor functions.
Part II:
The dynamic equilibrium between free α,β-tubulin and
assembled microtubules plays
a important role in cellular structure. Alteration of this
equilibrium by paclitaxel
(PTX) and other similar compounds is a critical method of
anti-cancer treatment, and
recently analogs were discovered that induce polymerization at
levels much greater
than paclitaxel. These analogs were placed into a crystal structure
of ,-tubulin
with PTX and subjected to molecular dynamics simulation. Over the
simulation the
analogs induced changes in the critical M-loop and strengthened
theories of how the
M-loop facilitates tubulin polymerization.

A cyclic pentapeptide was analyzed using NAMFIS (NMR Analysis of
Molecular Flex-
ibility In Solution), a method which combines NMR data and
modeling-based con-
formational searching. This peptide was well-studied in the
literature, providing an
opportunity to evaluate NAMFIS alongside other methods for
predicting conforma-
tions of small molecules in solution. NAMFIS was able to identify
the conformations","1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Confinement of Colloidal Suspensions in Cylindrical Geometries and
the Decoupling of
Rotational and Translational Diffusion in a 2D Granular
Experiment
We study binary colloidal suspensions confined within a glass
microcapillary to model the glass
transition in confined cylindrical geometries. We use high speed
three-dimensional confocal
microscopy to observe particle dynamics. The use of a slightly
tapered microcapillary enables us to
probe a range of local volumes for a single colloidal sample. We
observe that confinement of the
sample slows down particles. In addition, the particles form layers
against the capillary walls; these
layers also influence particle mobility. We split the mobility into
three components and see that all
components slow down close to the boundary. As the microcapillary
is made smaller, all three
components of mobility start to show large fluctuations due to the
closely packed layers that form
in tight spaces. We found that when the volume fraction is
increased, the ""bulk"" mobility of the
system decreases.
We also experimentally study the rotation and diffusion of granular
clusters in a 2D binary granular
system. Our apparatus vibrates a 2D system of densely packed
granular bidisperse disks (to avoid
crystallization) containing a trackable 3-particle cluster. We use
this system to mimic hard-sphere
fluids and the clusters probe the system's local translational and
rotational dynamics. As the area
fraction of the bidisperse disks is increased, diffusion within the
sample becomes slower, and above
a critical area fraction, the sample behaves as a granular glass.
We analyze the rotational and
translational motions of the clusters to determine whether they
decouple with changing area
fraction of the system. As we approach the glass transition, we
observe a decoupling between the
two motions.","List of Figures 1 -- 1 Chapter 1: Introduction 3 -- 1.1 Jamming and

for the Emory University School of Medicine and Project Medishare
Surgery Trip","Background: Surgical pathology comprises a large portion
of the global burden of disease - disproportionately affecting low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs). As LMICs currently lack the
healthcare infrastructure, healthcare personnel, and training to
handle this caseload, an unknown amount of surgery is performed by
international organizations. Despite this, there is a paucity of
data regarding the quality of care provided by these groups. The
Emory University School of Medicine and Project Medishare
(EUSOM-PM) surgery trip attempts to increase access to surgical
services in the Central Plateau of Haiti, but has yet to establish
a system to assess the quality of care provided to patients.
Objective: The goal of this thesis is to define
indicators of surgical quality applicable to a low-resource setting
and to establish reliable data collection techniques for the
EUSOM-PM surgery trip.
Methods: Indicators of surgical quality validated in
the United States that were transferable to a low-resource setting
were included in a data collection instrument. The instrument was
used to gather information regarding structural, process, and
outcome elements of patient care
Results: Quantitative data collected using the data
instrument had high response rates and provided complete
information regarding patient demographics, processes of care, and
outcomes.
Conclusions: A standardized data collection instrument
results in more complete data regarding the patient population and
the quality of care provided. However, the small quantity of data,
particularly the low rates of adverse postoperative outcomes,
limits any conclusions regarding the validity of indicators.
Continued use of the data instrument will allow for the generation
of a multi-year aggregated data set, providing information about
shifts in patient demographics, reflect alterations in care
processes, and potentially, the impact of these factors on patient
outcomes.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Introduction -- 1.1 Introduction 1

published,emory:d70j3,"Ricks, Jacob Isaac","The Politics of Participation: Irrigation Associations in Southeast
Asia","Institutions for collective action are vital to accomplishing a
variety of difficult developmental tasks, including irrigation
management. For decades experts have argued collective action
institutions for farmer participation, called water user
organizations, are essential for improving water resource
management. Such organizations increase the efficiency and efficacy
of irrigation. In order to function, though, they require a
favorable policy framework. Despite this knowledge, very few
countries have been able to develop the recipe of policies
necessary for participatory irrigation management. Why? I propose
that the observed variation can be explained by the political
environment. In this dissertation I advance a theory based on the
preferences of three sets of policy actors: politicians, top-level
bureaucrats, and street-level bureaucrats. I argue that politicians
will only expend the resources necessary to develop institutional
capacity when they are faced with significant political
vulnerability paired with a low degree of policy influence from
bureaucrats. I test my theoretical expectations by conducting a
controlled comparison of participatory irrigation management
policies and their implementation across four Asian countries:
Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Postulating that
the theory should have a similar effect at the sub-national level,
I also conducted comparative case studies of seven water user
organizations in Indonesia and nine water user organizations in
Thailand. I found that the national case comparisons supported my
argument. In contrast, my sub-national comparisons show that,
without a national policy framework favorable to participatory
irrigation management, the success of water user organizations
depends less on political vulnerability than on the attitudes and
actions of street-level bureaucrats. These actions are largely
determined by the incentive structures within the irrigation
agency, but they may also be influenced by personal relationships
with the communities in which they serve. Thus water user
organizations are best able to emerge in states where a favorable
policy framework developed due to the presence of political
vulnerability and a lack of bureaucratic policy control. When such
conditions do not exist, though, water user organizations may still
emerge, contingent upon the incentives of street-level
bureaucrats.","Chapter 1: Introduction 1 -- Chapter 2: Theory and Research Design

published,emory:ph8jr,"Przybylinski, Thomas John","New Insights Into the Similarity and Difference of Propositional
Models Via Symmetry","Recently, there has been an increased interest in finding
diverse solutions to propositional formula. Modern SAT solvers are
capable of producing a large number of models very efficiently.
However, this can result in an overwhelming number of nearly
indistinguishable results. Hence, finding a general way to discount
most of these variants and leaving a semantically diverse set of
solutions is an important problem. Historically, diversity
techniques concentrated on distance, while uniform sampling and
global symmetries have been put forward as diversity concepts.

No work in this area has closely examined diversity in general nor
examined when their concepts return inferior results. In this
dissertation we closely examine different notions of diversity, and
show that existing criteria are lacking in different ways. We
present a structure for unifying and combining previous notions of
diversity, and study their relative power to discriminate
solutions.

We then consider two new notions of diversity: local symmetry and
constructive symmetry, that we show to be more intuitively
satisfying. We analyze theoretical and computational properties,
and present different algorithms. A comprehensive set of
experiments are presented to explore different strategies.","1 Introduction 1 -- 2 Technical Background and Related Work 3 --

published,emory:d7t8g,"Robbins, Erin Elizabeth",Inequity Aversion and Fairness in Development,"Central to the issue of fairness is inequity aversion, a
description of the malaise individuals experience when they have
more (advantageous inequity) or less (disadvantageous inequity)
than another. Aversion to inequity emerges between five to seven
years, as evidenced by children's relatively egalitarian
distribution of resources. However, contemporary accounts of
inequity aversion tend to reduce inequity aversion to a general
preference for fair outcomes, a tautological and intractable
position.
From the perspective of development, it is unclear why
such an inequity aversion unfolds, let alone manifests into the
principled and ethical stance children adopt by five years of age.
This dissertation addresses the circularity that has characterized
many accounts of inequity aversion by proposing three proximate
mechanisms (risk aversion, competition aversion, and loss aversion)
that subtend the emergence of egalitarianism in three- to
seven-year-old children.
Competition and risky gambles have the potential to create
inequity if they result in a disparity of material wealth between
individuals. In Study 1 children's propensity to eschew competition
and minimize risk (both for themselves and a partner) predicted
individual and developmental differences in egalitarian
sharing.
Inequity aversion may also reflect a tension between the
affective experiences associated with losing versus gaining
resources. In Study 2, children estimated how much of a valuable
resource they had won or lost. Although the objective magnitude of
the losses and gains was equivalent, by seven years children
displayed robust signs of loss aversion by overestimating
personal losses and simultaneously underestimating personal
gains, a trend that correlated with egalitarian sharing.
Finally, Study 3 examined how children rectify perceived
inequity. By five years, but not prior, children selectively punish
selfish sharing partners and compensate generous sharing partners,
even when doing so comes at a personal cost.
In all, considerable asymmetries characterize inequity
aversion: the relative influence of competition and risk, the
subjective experience of losses and gains, and the relative
importance placed on personal welfare versus that of a partner. It
is arguably the resolution of these tensions that drives
development, eventually forming the basis of the child's
principled, ethical stance toward others that emerges by five years
of age.","--

Exercise-induced improvements in cancer-related fatigue may be
differentially moderated in patients during and following
treatment. However, these effects have not been
systematically reviewed. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, the
population effect size for exercise training on cancer-related
fatigue during and following treatment was estimated and the
extent to which the effect is differentiated across the time course
of treatment and recovery was determined.
Articles published before August, 2011 were retrieved using
Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science
databases. Seventy studies involving 4,881 cancer patients during
or following treatment were selected. Articles included a
cancer-related fatigue outcome measured at baseline and
post-intervention and randomized allocation to an exercise or
non-exercise comparison. Hedges' d effect sizes were
computed, study quality was evaluated, and random effects models
were used to estimate sampling error and population
variance.
Exercise significantly reduced cancer-related fatigue by a mean
effect size Î” (95%CI) of 0.32 (0.21, 0.43) and 0.38
(0.21, 0.54) during and following cancer treatment, respectively.
During treatment, patients with lower baseline fatigue scores and
higher exercise adherence rates realized the largest improvements.
Following treatment, improvements were largest for trials with
longer durations between completion of treatment and initiation of
exercise, trials with shorter exercise program lengths, and trials
using waitlist comparisons. 
Exercise reduces cancer-related fatigue among patients during
and following cancer treatment. These effects are differentially
moderated over the time course of treatment and recovery. Exercise
has a palliative effect in patients undergoing treatment and a
recuperative effect following treatment.

Pest","Many insects are host to microbial symbionts that often
play a pivotal role in shaping the insects' abilities to utilize
resources. Symbioses can be context-dependent, as
different biotic and abiotic factors can alter the relationship
between symbiont and host. Because of these two
factors, the symbionts of invasive insects are important for study
as their host ranges can be dictated by their symbionts, and their
relationships with their symbionts can be altered by the novel
conditions invasive organisms must face. Here, we investigate the
relationship between diet and within-host symbiont populations in
the stinkbug Megacopta cribraria, which invaded
North America in 2009. To examine the host-symbiont
association in its new environment, we reared M.
cribraria on two alternative host plants, kudzu vines
(Pueraria lobata) and soybeans
(Glycine max), and measured within-host
symbiont densities at various stages of development.
We found that juveniles and adult females, but not adult
males, reared on soybean had significantly lower symbiont densities
than those raised on kudzu. The lowered fitness of the symbiont in
insects reared on soybean is surprising as the symbiont is
genetically similar to the Japanese strain which
confers host usage of soybean; it may be that the soybean in the
United States differs from that of Japan. Additionally, the lowered
symbiont densities found in adult females reared on soy may impact
symbiont transmission, which in turn would limit the potential
range for Megacopta cribraria in the United
States. These results highlight the impact of
environmental context on host-symbiont partnerships.","Chapter 1: Introduction 1 -- Symbiosis in Context 1 -- Study System

If She Says Yes or Is Silent: A New Interpretation of Female
Marital Consent in the
Settlement Period in Iceland as Revealed Through the Family
Sagas
By Jill M. Fortney
This thesis seeks to explain how female marital consent functioned
in Saga-Age
(870 ­ 1050) Iceland by examining the Family Sagas and the Law
Code. It is in part a
response to the work of another scholar, Jenny Jochens and her book
Women in Old
Norse Society. Jochens believes that female marital consent did not
exist in Iceland
during the Saga Age and that any mention of it in the Sagas is a
Christian interpolation
and does not represent historical fact. This thesis seeks to
counter that argument by
arguing that the authors of the Sagas, while Christian, did not
have a writing program that
included inserting female marital consent when there was none
before.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Sagas as Sources for

Pre-Term Infants","Introduction: Premature infants are at increased risk for
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS),
the third leading cause of US infant mortality.The relationship
between gestational age at birth
and age at death among SIDS cases may have important implications
for understanding
physiological changes occurring during the critical developmental
period after birth. We
compared age at death distributions between SIDS infants born
preterm and term, and also
stratified by race and Hispanic origin and sex.

Methods: Data were obtained from the US Birth Cohort Linked
Birth/Infant Death Data Sets for
2003-2005. Analysis was restricted to singleton infants born to US
resident mothers between 28
and 41 weeks gestation, who died of SIDS in the postneonatal period
(n=5,017). SIDS cases
were identified from the death certificate underlying International
Classification of Diseases-10th
revision (ICD-10) cause-of-death code, R95. Infants were
categorized into four gestational age
categories: very preterm (28-33 weeks), late preterm (34-36 weeks),
early term (37-38 weeks),
and term gestations (39-41 weeks). We compared age at death
distributions and used Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) to evaluate differences in mean chronological age
at death between
gestational age categories.
 Results: Chronological age at death
distributions for each gestational age group peaked at
approximately 9 weeks . Mean chronological age at death of
SIDS was 15.2 weeks among very
preterm infants, 14.6 weeks among late preterm infants, 13.9 weeks
among early term infants and
14.3 weeks among term infants. Mean chronological ages at death by
gestational age group
stratified by race and Hispanic origin or infant sex were
similar.

Discussion: We report no clinically meaningful difference
between gestational age at birth and
chronological age at death for SIDS infants. Race-specific and
sex-specific findings are similar.
Use of clinically meaningful gestational age cut points provides an
insight into the relationship
between gestational age at birth and chronological age at death for
SIDS. Contrary to prior
reports, the critical window of vulnerability does not appear to be
modified by gestational age at
birth. Caregivers should be aware of the increased SIDS risk among
preterm infants, but should
practice SIDS risk reduction for all infants regardless of
gestational age at birth.","Table of Contents --  -- CHAPTER I: LITERATURE REVIEW

Fighting the Mental Fight: Virginia Woolf's Lessons for
Transforming Cultural Ideologies
By David Smith
The following essay, ""Fighting the Mental Fight,"" explores the
capabilities of Virginia
Woolf's final novel Between the Acts to transform cultural
ideologies and political allegiances.
My reading of the novel begins with Woolf's criticism of culture
and nation-of England's
demanding imperial economy, masculine penchant for war, and
educational commitment to
training men for imperial imperatives rather than individual
gratifications. The purpose of
Between the Acts is to un-bind her readers to those
cultural imperatives or, as she says in her
novel-essay on war Three Guineas, to free her readers from
those ""unreal loyalties."" Beyond
noting examples of characters' subjectivity and conversations as
cultural reflections, I argue that
Woolf's novel teaches her reader how to critically assess
themselves and their culture. Woolf
transforms the ways in which her readers interpret events of
history, society, and their own
private lives. Her fiction, thus, makes one aware of the forces
that affirm and perpetuate
destructive cultural ideologies. This socio-political recognition,
which requires the critical and
creative capacities of the mind that the act of reading fiction
(particularly Woolf's) can enhance,
allows for the possibility to resist or revise crippling cultural
ideologies.","Table of Contents -- Introduction - 1 -- 1. Training for War - 4 --

Genetic ablation of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)
results in
fragile X syndrome (FXS), a mental retardation disorder associated
with a high
susceptibility to epilepsy. FMRP is expressed from the FMR1
gene. FMRP is an mRNA
binding protein crucial for local translation at synapses,
suggesting that aberrant synaptic
protein synthesis in the absence of FMRP might be the reason for
compromised cognition
and facilitated epileptogenesis. However, until now it is unclear
if translational
dysregulation of any specific target mRNA contributes to the
epileptic phenotype of FXS.

A potential candidate is the potassium channel Kv4.2 which is
fundamental for
the regulation of neuronal excitability and, importantly, has been
shown to be mutated in
an inherited form of epilepsy. Preliminary data from the Bassell
lab demonstrate that
Kv4.2 mRNA associates with and might therefore be translationally
regulated by FMRP.
To test this hypothesis, I first analyzed dendritic Kv4.2 protein
levels in brains from wild
type and Fmr1 knockout mice by immunohistochemistry and
western blot analysis. With
immunohistochemistry, I found significant downregulation of Kv4.2
protein in the Fmr1
knockout. With western blot analysis, I found that dysregulation of
Kv4.2 protein in the
Fmr1 knockout may be brain-region and cell-compartment
specific.

To determine if Kv4.2 downregulation in the absence of FMRP is
specific, I
conducted similar experiments on potassium channels Kv1.2 and
Kv3.4.
Immunohistochemistry conducted on these proteins found no change in
protein
expression in the Fmr1 knockout. I also conducted
immunohistochemistry experiments
on NMDA receptor subunit NR1, an mRNA known not to associate with
FMRP. NR1
protein expression is not dysregulated in the Fmr1 knockout.
These data suggest that loss
of FMRP does not cause a broad scale downregulation of ion channels
and receptors.
Furthermore, protein downregulation in the absence of FMRP may be
dependent on
FMRP-mRNA binding in wild type neurons. Using fluorescent in
situ hybridization, I
also found Kv4.2 mRNA localized in the dendritic fields in the
hippocampus, suggesting
a mechanism by which FMRP regulates neuronal excitability. My
results suggest that
Kv4.2 might be an important molecular determinant of FXS-related
epilepsy.","Table of Contents -- Abstract -- Acknowledgements -- Translational

Men Living in Geographical Areas Not Included in the NHBS","Background: Recently, surveillance of the HIV epidemic in
the U.S. has expanded. The
current behavioral surveillance system uses venue-based sampling
methodology and is
only inclusive of certain metropolitan statistical areas. With the
expansion of web-based
research, MSM may be more accessible for inclusion in surveillance
systems.
Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility,
usefulness, and cost effectiveness
of recruiting men online from states where data are not collected
as part of the National
HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) and determine if special
strategies are
needed to reach rural MSM.
Methods: Data on HIV risk behaviors, testing history, and
use of prevention services
were collected through an online survey targeted towards MSM over
18 years of age in
three states not included in the NHBS (Iowa, Minnesota, and South
Carolina).
Participant characteristics were modeled with three outcomes
(unprotected anal
intercourse (UAI) with most recent male sex partner, disclosure
male-male sex to a
provider, and having an HIV test in the past year) using logistic
regression. Cost per
completed interview was compared to cost for general US surveys of
MSM; usefulness
will be evaluated with a 6-month follow-up evaluation with
participating health
departments.
Results: A total of 516 men completed the survey. 206 (47%)
were from rural areas.
Rural men had decreased odds of disclosing male-male sex to their
provider (aOR=0.37).
Those who disclosed having sex with men to their provider had
increased odds of ever
testing for HIV (aOR=3.06) and receiving a hepatitis C test in the
past year (aOR=4.05).
73% of rural MSM and 65% of urban MSM engaged in UAI in the past
year. 89% of
participants (n=403) were white, non-Hispanic. The average cost per
completed survey
was $10.82 overall and was highest ($16.25) in South
Carolina.
Discussion: Rural MSM engaged in high-risk behavior and were
less likely to discuss
their sexual behaviors with a provider. These disparities
demonstrate the need to include
these areas in national surveillance systems to monitor trends in
behavior and assess
prevention efforts. The high cost of recruiting MSM from these
areas demonstrates the
need for developing and evaluating new online recruitment
methodology.","LIST OF TABLES -- i -- INTRODUCTION -- 1 -- BACKGROUND -- 2 --

Services for HIV-Infected Alcohol Users Leaving Jail","Background:Alcohol use disorders
continue to be a serious public health problem in the U.S. with
more than half of the American population aged 12 years or older
reporting current alcohol use. Crimes associated with alcohol use
range from driving while intoxicated to assault and homicide.
Approximately 40% of the inmates in the U.S report to have been
under the influence of alcohol at the time of offence. A strong
dose-relationship has been reported between alcohol use and
increased high risk behaviors for HIV transmission, and poor
adherences to HIV medication. If alcohol use is associated with
poorer linkage to care upon release from jails, greater efforts to
assess and treat alcohol disorders in jail settings may be
warranted. This research aims at determining if problematic alcohol
use among HIV-infected detainees influences linkage to HIV care in
the community upon release from jails.
Methods: The analysis was conducted
as part of Enhance Link Initiative a multi-site evaluation project
across 10 jail sites. A longitudinal study design was used where
data were collected on 348 HIV infected individuals at study
enrollment, post release and six month after jail release. A
composite score (CS) from the Addiction Severity Index was used to
determine the severity of alcohol and drug use. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to test the hypotheses.
Results: More than half of the
participants reported using alcohol in the past 30 days before
their incarceration. Among them, 40% reported using alcohol with no
drug involvement. There was a trend among the 120 individuals whose
alcohol CS was greater than 0.23 to be less likely to link to care
but the association was not statistically significant. Significant
predictors of linkage included male gender and taking HIV
medication in the 7 days before incarceration.
Discussion:Findings suggest the need
to treat alcohol use disorders among HIV-infected jail detainees in
order to enhance linkage to community HIV care .Substance abuse
treatment in jail settings tends to focus on availing treatment to
people using drugs. HIV infected individuals who abuse alcohol may
need alcohol specific services to improve rates of linkage to
community health care.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW

Negrometraje, Literature and Race in Revolutionary Cuba
By Aisha Z. Cort
Negrometraje, Literature and Race in Revolutionary Cuba,
explores the expression of
Afro-Cuban identity and its illustration by Afro-Cuban writers and
filmmakers within the
context of the Cuban Revolution. It answers two questions. First,
how does Afro-Cuban
artistic expression of Afro-Cuban reality change from the 1970s to
the 1990s? and
second, how can we reread works from Afro-Cuban writers and
filmmakers within the
context of the Cuban Revolution in light of the ideological
disconnects between
Revolution, racial discourse, and artistic expression? To answer
these questions I looked
to a diverse group of Afro-Cuban artists who produced
groundbreaking works during the
1970s and 1990s.
Beginning with Nancy Morejón, the dissertation delves deeper
into the evolution of Afro-Cuban aesthetics
with the cinematic works of Nicolas Guillen Landrian in the 1960s,
Sara Gómez and
Sergio Giral in the 1970s and finally Gloria Rolando in the 1990s.
These are all artists
whose work has previously never been considered in concert, but
together, their works
engage in an interesting dialogue and provide a collective answer
to the research
questions on which this project is based.
In the 50 years of the history of the Cuban Revolution, few
dissertations have considered
such a broad range of works of Afro-Cuban narrative. This project
deliberately moves
chronologically from the early years of the revolution into the
1970s and finally into the
1990s; providing a unique perspective on the trajectory of
Afro-Cuban cultural
production and the development and varied manifestations of an
Afro-Cuban aesthetic.
The extensive focus on film aids in the expansion of the literary
imagination, as well as
broadens the idea of what constitutes narrative.

published,emory:7qn2x,"Hanson, Nicola Diane","Effects of stress and psychoactive
drugs on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the rat","The subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus is one of only two
sites of adult
neurogenesis in mammalian species. It is widely hypothesized to be
downregulated by
psychological stress and upregulated by antidepressant drugs and to
play a role in the
psychopathology of major depression. However, increasing evidence
of inconsistencies
and complications surrounding this hypothesis has led to the
questioning of its accuracy
and support for a more nuanced understanding of the relation of
hippocampal
neurogenesis to other stress-regulated systems of the brain. The
experiments presented
here show that the processes involved in hippocampal neurogenesis,
primarily
proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPC), are not susceptible
to alteration by either
psychological stress or antidepressant drugs under all
circumstances. Robust and
prolonged stress experiences, including restraint, tail shock, and
social defeat, failed to
affect the proliferation rate of NPCs and short or long term
survival of resulting newborn
cells. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
fluoxetine and escitalopram,
the CRF1 antagonist R121919, and the atypical antipsychotics
paliperidone and
ziprasidone also failed to affect neurogenesis in any measure
examined. Chronic
treatment with the mood stabilizer lithium caused a significant
increase in NPC
proliferation but no alteration in survival rate of newborn cells.
Additionally, NPC
proliferation in adolescent animals showed no greater responsivity
to either stress or
drug treatment than was seen in young adults. These results,
seemingly in conflict with
the accepted model of the association of adult hippocampal
neurogenesis with stress
and antidepressant drug response, are part of an emerging, more
complex grasp of the
role neuroplasticity plays in stress response.","1: Background 1 -- A. Timeline and markers of hippocampal

Prepregnancy Obesity Trends in 20 States:
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS),
2003-2009

Context: Prepregnancy obesity is a well-documented risk
factor for a broad range of obstetric
complications. Prepregnancy obesity prevalence increased in the US
during 1993-2003.
Prepregnancy obesity trends have not been assessed since
2003.
Objective: To calculate the trend in prevalence of
prepregnancy obesity among women who
delivered live births in the United States, by state, age, and
race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
Asian/Pacific Islander, other),
during 2003-2009.
Methods: We measured prepregnancy obesity (body mass index
[BMI] â‰¥30 kg/m2) trends using
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data from 2003,
2006, and 2009. We
included twenty states with data for all three study years in the
trend analysis, providing a sample
of 90,774 women. We calculated BMI using self-reported height and
weight from questionnaires
completed 3-6 months after delivery. We used a chi-square test for
trend to determine
significance of actual and standardized trends, standardized to the
age and race-ethnicity
distribution of the 2003 study population.
Results: Prepregnancy obesity prevalence increased by an
average of +0.5 percentage points per
year, from 17.6% in 2003 to 20.7% in 2009 (p&lt;0.001). Obesity
increased among women ages 20-
24 (p&lt;0.001), 30-34 (p=0.001), and â‰¥35 years
(p=0.003), and among non-Hispanic white
(p&lt;0.001), non-Hispanic black (p=0.02), Hispanic (p=0.01), and
other women (p=0.03). Overall,
the mean rate of increase slowed from +0.6 percentage points per
year during 2003-2006 to +0.4
percentage points per year during 2006-2009. Among non-Hispanic
black women, however, the
mean rate of increase doubled from +0.4 percentage points per year
during 2003-2006 to +0.8
percentage points per year during 2006-2009. In 2009, prepregnancy
obesity prevalence was
highest among women â‰¥35 years (24.0%) and
non-Hispanic black women (29.2%) and lowest
among women &lt;20 years (11.4%) and Asian/Pacific Islanders
(7.2%). 
Conclusions: Prepregnancy obesity prevalence continues to
increase, and varies by race-ethnicity
and maternal age. These findings highlight the need to address
obesity as a key component of
preconception care, particularly among high-risk groups.","Table of Contents -- Table of Contents -- Chapter 1:

Door Clinic, Middlebury, Vermont","Due to the passing of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), there are
more options for health insurance for all residents and citizens of
the United States, but the ACA does not provide insurance options
for the undocumented people in the United States, leaving over 9
million undocumented Latinos involuntarily uninsured. Furthermore,
with the growing need for workers in the agriculture industry,
undocumented Latino workers are starting to populate areas where
they have never lived before. Vermont, because of its huge dairy
industry has become one of the new destinations for undocumented
farm workers. Because of the lack of diversity in Vermont and its
proximity to Canadian border patrol, the undocumented population
suffers from unique barriers to care. The Open Door Clinic, a free
clinic in Middlebury that serves all of Addison Country, Vermont,
serves as a health clinic for the uninsured population in southern
Vermont. With this influx of new undocumented workers and a new
trend of these workers remaining longer in Vermont, the Open Door
Clinic has slowly transformed into a makeshift medical home for
many Latinos in this area. With this change in its community role,
Open Door sought to change programing to establish stronger
relationships between the Latino population and local communities
to facilitate preventive health behaviors and access to medical
care. Using Middlebury College students and prominent Latino farm
worker community members, the Open Door Clinic created and
implemented a Community Health Worker Program. The following

Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Preschool-Aged Children","Background:
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most
frequently observed neurobehavioral disorder in children and has
consequences for the academic achievement, social interactions and
the well-being of children. Peak onset occurs at 3-4 years old. Due
to the significant implications of ADHD, studies are needed to
assess the exposures experienced in childhood that may affect this
disorder. Previous studies have found a positive association
between breastfeeding and neuropsychological development.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the
relationship between breastfeeding and ADHD in preschool-aged
children in the U.S. using data from the National Survey of
Children's Health (NSCH).
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional
study using data from the 2007 NSCH for children 2 to 5 years old.
In the primary analysis, breastfeeding was the independent variable
and defined as whether or not a child ever breastfed. ADHD was the
dependent variable and defined as whether or not a child had ADHD
or ADD. In secondary analysis, exclusivity of breastfeeding and
taking medication for ADHD or ADD were evaluated as independent and
dependent variables, respectively. Child sex, race, poverty level,
family structure, mental health of parents, education of parents,
smoking status of parents and birth weight were examined as
potential effect modifiers.
Results: The attempt to assess for effect
modification was limited by sparse data, and despite some
suggestion of effect modification, the data could not adequately be
stratified. The results of the primary analysis showed that
children who did not breastfeed had 2.00 (0.58-6.90) the odds of
having ADHD as those who breastfed controlling for poverty level,
mental health of the mother, and education of the mother. However,
the results of this model as well as those in the secondary
analyses indicated that the relationship between breastfeeding and
ADHD was not significant.
Conclusions: The overall results of this analysis found that
breastfeeding was not significantly associated with children aged 2
to 5 years who had ADHD as measured in data from the NSCH in 2007.
However, due to a small sample size as well as differing results of
other studies, further evaluation is warranted.","--  -- Table of Contents -- Chapter I: Introduction.

resettling in the United States. This can have
detrimental consequences on the health of this population,
particularly on young children, who need adequate nutrition for
proper physical and cognitive development. In
Clarkston, a small city in DeKalb County, Georgia, and home to a
large population of refugees, food insecurity is a prevalent
issue. The Mommy and Me Family Literacy Program
(MMFLP), a program in Clarkston that is run through the
organization Friends of Refugees, offers English literacy classes
to refugee women and their children under the age of five.
To address food insecurity and poor nutritional status among
the students at this school, the program director would like to
incorporate nutrition classes into the ESL curriculum.
This special studies project focuses on the development of a
culturally appropriate nutrition curriculum for MMFLP that will
address healthy eating in the United States, along with safe and
affordable access to nutritious food in Clarkston. The
curriculum is guided by empowerment theory, with the goal of
empowering refugee women to make healthy decisions for themselves
and their families. It consists of eight 30-minute
lessons; the first four take place in the fall semester and focus
on dietary diversity, while the second four are delivered in the
spring semester, focusing on access to healthy food and overcoming
barriers. Five of the eight lessons were piloted
during the 2014-2015 school year, each of which have been revised
accordingly. After revisions, a final product was
created based on input from the students, classroom observations,
and suggestions from MMFLP staff, along with Emory public health
faculty. Future directions for this curriculum
include: piloting the remaining lessons, improving and implementing
evaluation measures, and writing grants for additional
funding. Additionally, collaboration with other
organizations working in Clarkston is necessary in order to reach a
larger population of resettling refugees.","Chapter 1:

Effects of High Frequency Electrical Stimulation of the Infralimbic
Cortex on Cellular
Activity in the Rodent Brain
By Ashwin G. Ramayya
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subgenual cingulate (Cg25)
white matter
(WM) is a novel surgical therapy which has recently been used to
treat severely
depressed, treatment-resistant individuals. While it has shown
significant therapeutic
effects, the mechanism by which DBS achieves clinical benefits is
not completely
understood. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that Cg25WM
DBS leads to a
suppression of metabolic activity in the Cg25, which is a known
mediator of negative
mood. In this study, we aimed to gain some understanding of how
this occurs by studying
the effects of acute high frequency stimulation (HFS) on cellular
activity in the rodent
brain. We targeted the infralimbic cortex (IL), the rodent
homologue of Cg25, and
quantified cellular activity by measuring the density of cells
expressing c-fos, an
Immediate Early Gene (IEG) which is expressed in the nucleus of
active cells. We
compared cellular activity in stimulated and non-stimulated rats
locally in the IL, in the
monosynaptically connected basomedial amygdala (BMA) and the
polysynaptically
connected hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). We found there to be a
greater cellular
activity in all three regions of the stimulated brain, suggesting
that Cg25WM DBS has
far-reaching acute effects on cellular activity. The increased
cellular activity in the IL was
found to be statistically significant; however, there were not
enough subjects to
conclusively determine the significance of increased cellular
activity in the BMA and the
DG.

baumannii","Antibiotic resistance has become a major public health
concern as the prevalence of multi-drug resistant pathogens
continues to rise. Acinetobacter baumannii is a
highly antibiotic resistant, nosocomial pathogen, that is a
significant cause of ventilator-acquired pneumonia and other
infections. Its ability to survive for prolonged periods under
harsh conditions and to subvert the host immune system makes it
difficult to combat. Although seldom used for decades due to their
nephrotoxicity, polymyxins are now used for the treatment of
A. baumannii infections as the last-resort drug
therapy. Thus, it is crucial to understand how polymyxins kill
bacteria, and the mechanisms the bacteria use to acquire resistance
to these drugs and handicap the host innate immune system. I have
shown that polymyxins kill A. baumannii through
induction of a hydroxyl radical death pathway. Furthermore, I
investigated the genetic basis of polymyxin B resistance in
A. baumannii and identified PrpA
(Polymyxin
resistance
protein A) as an
important determinant. In the absence of
prpA, A. baumannii was more
susceptible to killing by polymyxin B. The mutant strain also has a
defect in biofilm formation. Thorough analysis of PrpA will provide
insight into a new mechanism that A. baumannii
uses to evade killing, and potentially provide us with a new
therapeutic target to treat future infections. Since PrpA is highly
conserved, it is very likely that the same mechanism is utilized by
other Gram-negative pathogens as well.","INTRODUCTIONÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.1

Liturgical Generation of Eco-theology","This dissertation explores the role of baptismal water at the
Easter Vigil in cultivating responsible eco-theological
orientation. Three sets of sources are examined, including
twentieth century liturgical theology concerned with the
eco-theological and cosmic dimensions of baptismal water at the
Easter Vigil, accounts in cognitive science of the
meaning-generative character of water, and an ethnographic account
of Easter Vigil baptisms at one local congregation. The examination
of liturgical theologians especially focuses on the work of Kevin
W. Irwin, Aidan Kavanagh, Gordon W. Lathrop, and Alexander
Schmemann, and discerns in their work some common proposals for the
reform of baptismal rites at the Easter Vigil. In an analysis of
cognitive scientific studies of water as a source domain, the image
schematic structures of water are outlined largely by way of the
CONTAINER and SOURCE-PATH-GOAL image schemas, with a focus on the
significance of entailments peculiar to the source domain of water.
The ethnographic account details the place of baptismal water in
the significance ascribed to Easter Vigil baptisms in one
congregation. Building on a synthetic analysis of the
liturgical-theological, cognitive scientific, and ethnographic
accounts, three practices are explored in detail for their capacity
to foster responsible eco-theological orientation at the baptismal
water of the Easter Vigil: praying in thanksgiving over the
baptismal water, the act of baptismal washing, and extra-liturgical
engagement with local watersheds.","INTRODUCTION.....1 -- CHAPTER 1: LITURGICAL THEOLOGIANS AND THE

Immune Tolerance Induction","The formation of factor VIII (fVIII) inhibitory antibodies
is a major complication of hemophilia A. Immune tolerance induction
(ITI) is successful in up to 70% of patients. The probability and
predictors of inhibitor recurrence following successful ITI are
unknown. The study's objectives are to determine the influence of
discontinuation and adherence of post-ITI prophylaxis on inhibitor
recurrence, and the probability of recurrence following successful
ITI.
In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, 84 male
patients with Hemophilia A who successfully completed ITI based on
local institutional criteria were enrolled. Sixty four subjects
with fVIII &lt;2% who were considered tolerant following ITI based
on a negative inhibitor titer and normalized recovery level and/or
half-life were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier method and logistic
regression models were used to estimate the probability of
inhibitor recurrence at 1, 3 and 5 years and to determine the
association between clinical characteristics,
including adherence to post-ITI prophylaxis and
inhibitor recurrence.
Sixty four (76%) patients with fVIII level &lt; 2% met
criteria for tolerance and were included in the analysis: 45
(70.3%) subjects did not have a recurrent inhibitor titer and 19
(29.7%) had at least one inhibitor titer &gt; 0.6
BU/ml. The probability of recurrent inhibitor at 1 year was 0.17
(95% CI: [0.05, 0.20]); at 3 years was 0.27 (95% CI: [0.2, 0.4])
and 5 years was 0.35 (95% CI: [0.2, 0.5]). Adherence to
prophylactic fVIII infusion was found not to be statistically
significant associated with inhibitor-free status (p=0.88).
However, the odds of inhibitor recurrence were 11.1 and 9.0 higher
in patients who received immunosuppression and in those whose
recovery level was &lt; 85%, respectively.
ITI is currently the most effective treatment to eradicate
fVIII inhibitors, however 5 years after ITI completion, 30-35% of
patients will have at least one inhibitor titer &gt;
0.6 BU/ml. A recurrent inhibitor is unlikely after 5 years of ITI.
Adherence to post-ITI prophylaxis does not appear to be a major
driver of inhibitor recurrence. FVIII recovery level with a cutoff
of 85%, and immunosuppression concomitant with ITI were found to be
associated with inhibitor recurrence.","-- Introduction --

Exceeding the Frame:
Documentary Filmmaker Marlon T. Riggs as Cultural Agitator
By Rhea L. Combs

Exceeding the Frame: Documentary Filmmaker Marlon T. Riggs as
Cultural Agitator argues that Marlon
Riggs was a crucially important nonfiction filmmaker, whose
outspoken work in African American
cultural production, and ""promiscuous"" approach to documentary
practice make him a cultural
agitator, one who used his craft as a tool of resistance to
interrogate the politics of identity,
specifically the notions of masculinity, sexuality, and race
constructed and disseminated in
American mass media.

Between 1981 and 1994, the prolific Riggs produced eight films and
videos. Before dying
from AIDS-related complications at 37, he also wrote numerous
scholarly articles and held
interviews on identity, politics, art and censorship, African
American cultural production, and
documentary film practice. As the first scholarly examination of
Riggs's entire body of video and
film works, this interdisciplinary project focuses on Riggs in a
social and artistic context, arguing
for his cultural significance in relation to prevalent
understandings of inter-and intra-racial identity,
HIV/AIDS, and black masculinity, as well as documentary film
practice, during the height of the
culture wars of the 1980s and early 1990s. I analyze his more
traditional documentaries: Long Train
Running (1981) , Ethnic Notions (1988) , and
Color Adjustment (1992); his most controversial and
innovative work, Tongues Untied (1989); and his more hybrid
and essayistic works: the
posthumously produced Black Is...Black Ain't (1995), along
with the experimental shorts Affirmations
(1990), Anthem (1991), and No Regret (1992). I
examine Riggs's oeuvre using his biography, critical
analysis, and reception studies to demonstrate how his work
formulates, in cinematic terms rather
than verbal discourse, the vital notion of Americans' multiple
identities.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

published,emory:g1pc4,"Smith, Sophie Elizabeth","Predicting influenza vaccination coverage by pregnancy intent in
women of childbearing age.","Influenza illness can result in severe complications,
particularly in the high risk population of pregnant women.
Maintaining high vaccination rates in women of childbearing age is
one way to prevent severe outcomes as a result of influenza
infection. The purpose of this investigation is to assess whether
there is an association between pregnancy intent in women of
childbearing age and receipt of the influenza vaccine. Data were
taken from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
from 2011 and included all women of childbearing age that answered
the optional Preconception Health and Family Planning module of the
questionnaire. The exposure was pregnancy intent, indicated by
women that were considering pregnancy within 2 years, after 2
years, or not at all, and the outcome was the receipt of the
influenza vaccine. Using multivariate logistic regression there was
no overall significant association between considering pregnancy
after 2 years (aOR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.74, 1.20), or considering
pregnancy within 2 years (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.27) and
vaccination status. Stratification by race showed a significant
interaction among women of Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific
Islanders, American Indian, Alaskan Natives, Multiracial, and other
non-specified races for both those considering pregnancy after 2
years, and women considering pregnancy within 2 years compared to
not at all, with adjusted odds ratios of 0.14 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.40)
and 0.39 (95%CI: 0.15, 0.99), respectively. Overall there was no
significant association between pregnancy intent and vaccination
status, but upon stratifying by race, there was significance among
specific populations, and women of those populations considering
pregnancy within 2 years or after 2 years were less likely to
receive the influenza vaccine. This indicates that pregnancy intent
in those populations is a significant predictor of influenza
vaccination for this study population.","--  --

Mapping the Journeys of Antiracist White Educators
We must dedicate our best efforts in teacher education to
prepare a ninety percent majority of white educators to meet the
needs of diverse students. As we simultaneously work toward a more
representative teaching force, fundamental to this task is
examining how antiracist white educators come to exist. The aim of
this two-part research study was to examine the racial
conceptualizations, teaching practices, and life experiences of
white teachers, teacher educators, and scholar-activists who are
committed to antiracism, culturally relevant pedagogy, and social
justice. Critical race theory, critical white studies, and theories
of culturally relevant pedagogy undergirded both studies. The first
portion of this research followed a nominated sample of twelve
white urban elementary school teachers. Those data uncovered that
some dominant ideologies regarding whiteness, cultural deficit
theory, and decontextualized racism can coexist even in the psyche
of white teachers who strongly espouse and genuinely demonstrate
commitments to antiracism and culturally relevant pedagogy. The
second study examined the racial understandings of well-known white
teacher educators and scholar-activists who are farther along in
their trajectories toward antiracism. The findings indicated that
antiracist white educators: (a) understand racism as foundational,
institutional, and intersectional; (b) maintain that whites are
mis-educated via Eurocentric curricula; and (c) firmly believe that
whiteness serves only to dehumanize both people of color and
whites. This cadre of scholar-activists cited duping and
dissonance, racial devastation and separation, exemplars and
efficacy, and subordinate-status relationships as origins of their
antiracism. Participants also used conscientious co-optation, white
proxyhood, and a keen understanding of ""privilege within privilege""
in their pedagogies with primarily white educators. These
antiracist educators also revealed possibilities for transnational
and global antiracist movements, that we might make significant
headway in the selection, preparation, and professional learning of
a majority white teaching force in education, and in the wider
struggle for social justice writ large.","-- TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Preface -- Chapter 1: Why White Teachers?

The Influence of Boundary Roughness on Dense Colloidal
Suspensions
By Daniel J. Real
We study the relationship between boundary conditions and
particle motion in confined, concentrated colloidal suspensions.
The study of glassy polymers in confinement has shown that changes
in mobility are strongly dependent upon the polymer-surface
interaction. We model this interaction by observing the effects of
textured surfaces on colloidal particle mobility in confined dense
suspensions (near the glass transition). We use confocal microscopy
to directly image and track the colloidal particles in thin,
wedge-shaped sample chambers made from textured glass. We texture
the glass in a controlled, reproducible manner by spincoating and
sintering colloidal suspensions onto glass slides. We found that
our results were compromised by the presence of unintentional
texture on the walls of our smooth slides. Both the mean squared
displacement, and the particle distribution within the confining
volume were found to be similar in both the textured and smooth
walled chambers. Despite a measured volume fraction of φ =
0.42 we observed behavior indicative of a much lower φ in both
samples. We did not observe layering within either sample, but we
believe this is due to the effectively low φ rather than the
textured boundary conditions. Although our results are
inconclusive, we have developed a method to create controlled,
reproducible textures. In the future, we hope to use these textures
to study the dynamics of the glass transition and its dependence on
interfacial dynamics versus finite size effects.","Table of Contents -- 1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

eating disorder characteristics","Background:
Little population-based data exist in the United Sates on the
epidemiology of racial/ethnic influences on the development of
binge eating disorder. Cross-national data on BED are presented and
compared among period prevalence and lifetime prevalence groups
using the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys.
Methods:
Cross-sectional survey data generated from the 2001-2003
Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) were used in
this study. CPES contains three national representative surveys:
the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), the National
Survey of American Life (NSAL), and the National Latino Asian
American Study (NLAAS). The survey population includes all United
Sates adults who are 18 years of age and older residing in housing
located in one of the 48 contiguous states.
Results:
Racial/Ethnic-specific prevalence estimates are consistently
higher within 12-Month and Lifetime BED groups. Crude estimates
show Hispanic/Latin-American survey respondents as having a higher
odds of endorsing 12-Month (OR: 1.85, 95%CI: 1.06 - 3.24) binge
eating disorder compared to Caucasians. Additionally, adjusted
estimate reports reveal a decreased odds of both 12-Month and
Lifetime BED when assessing the effect of immigration status on the
racial/ethnic category called ""other"".
Conclusion:
BED represents a public health problem greater than other eating
disorders such as Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa, with slight
differences among persons of different cultural/racial groups. New
and updated DSM-V BED guidelines exist that can guide research and
highlight the clinical importance of diagnosing and treating
patients with BED and other health problems.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I: Background and Literature

humans using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic
tractography","The amygdala plays a key role in emotional processing and
social behaviors in humans, nonhuman primates, and other mammals.
Although it is well established that the mammalian amygdala can be
divided into three anatomically and functionally distinct
subregions - basolateral, centromedial, and cortical - the internal
organization of these divisions and the absolute and relative sizes
of their connections vary substantially across species. Despite
this, studies of connectivity of the amygdala have heretofore been
concentrated in a relatively few experimental species - mainly
rodents and macaque monkeys. The development of the noninvasive
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technology has made it possible to
extend studies of connectivity to humans, and in this study, to
chimpanzees, our closest relatives. It gives us an opportunity to
compare humans to chimpanzees (and to macaques, based on the
literature), and gain insight into how the organization of the
amygdala changed during human evolution. In this study, DTI and
probabilistic tractography were used in a study of the distribution
of the major connections of the amygdala in chimpanzees and humans.
From this, we expected to identify the three major subregions in
both species and compared their size and distribution in humans to
interrogate possible differences in amygdalar organization between
species. My hypothesis was that the basolateral subdivision tracts
would be proportionately larger and stronger in humans as compared
to chimpanzees, because of its strong connections to sensory and
association areas, and the dramatic increase in the amount of
association cortex in human evolution. Furthermore, I hypothesized
that the centromedial and the cortical division tracts in humans
would be proportionately smaller because of their strong
connections to brainstem regions, and primary olfactory cortex,
respectively.","Table of Contents -- 1.

Stay or Leave? Externalization of the labor market and its
effect on gender earnings inequality in the U.S.
By
Anne-Kathrin Kronberg
As jobs in the U.S. became less secure and traditional job
ladders deteriorated,
employees increasingly turned to the ""external"" labor market to
build their career. This
thesis explores the relationship between the increasing importance
of the external labor
market and the gender earnings gap.
Using the 1979-2001 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID), I find
that over time, switching employers affects men and women
differently depending on
whether individuals leave the previous employer voluntarily or
involuntarily and whether
changes occur in the primary or secondary labor market. Since 1979,
gender earnings
disparities have increased among individuals changing employers
involuntarily. Even
when voluntarily changing employers, women increasingly fall behind
men. This effect
however, is specific to voluntary changers in the secondary labor
market. That is, gender
disparities are actually dramatically narrowing among those who
voluntarily leave their
previous employer in the primary labor market.
While the causal mechanisms driving these trends are still unknown,
the results speak
to the fact the externalization of the labor market opened
opportunities primarily to those
who are already in good positions. Most importantly, this study
advances our
understanding of the gender earnings gap.

Reproducibility of Ambulatory Blood Pressure monitoring (ABPM)
in
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
(ADPKD)
By Frederic F. Rahbari Oskoui, M.D.

Background: Non-dipping defined as less than 10% decline in
night/day systolic (SBP) and
diastolic blood pressures (DBP) by 24 hour ABPM is associated with
poor cardiovascular
outcomes in patients with essential hypertension. However,
controversies on reproducibility
of dipping status have been raised in both essential hypertension
and ADPKD. Therefore, we
established the short term reproducibility of ABPM in ADPKD.

Methods: 25 HALT-PKD trial participants with estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
&gt; 25 ml/min underwent ABPM on two occasions, 7-15 days apart,
after completion of
antihypertensive medication titration. Daytime was defined as
6:00-21:59 and night time as
22:00-6:00. Correlation and concordance coefficients for SBP, DBP,
mean arterial pressure
(MAP), heart rate (HR) and pulse pressure (PP) were determined
based on day/night
separation of the readings. Dipping was considered both as a
dichotomous and continuous
variable. Cohen's Kappa statistics were used to compare the
proportions of dippers and non-
dippers. Univariate analysis was performed to identify potential
associations between dipping
status and various characteristics.

Results: 29 patients were consented of whom 25 completed two
acceptable ABPMs. Mean
(+SD) age was 43.12 (8.55) years, age of onset for HBP 33.6 (11.1)
years, estimated GFR
63.1 (20.5) mL/min, BMI 26.6 (5.1) Kg/m2, baseline SBP and DBP were
129.6 (12.5) and
81.6 (6.5) mmHg. Mean (+SD) differences in daytime-nighttime blood
pressures were
11.74(8.2) and 10.82 (6.4) mmHg for SBP and DBP respectively.17/25
subjects (68%) were
either consistently non-dippers (11/25 or 44%) or consistently
dippers (6/25 or 24%). Two (8%)
were reverse-dippers. Eight (32%) changed their dipping status
between two measurements.
The overall Cohen's Kappa statistic was 0.34 (SD=0.18). Correlation
and concordance
coefficients were 0.881and 0.887 for daytime SBP, 0.862 and 0.882
for daytime DBP, 0.939-
0.897 for nighttime SBP and 0.932-0.887 for nighttime DBP
respectively. No variables
associated with the magnitude or consistency of dipping.

Conclusion: Repeated measures of SBP and DBP, 7-15 days apart,
are highly correlative and
concordant in treated hypertensive ADPKD patients. Non-dipping is
present in majority of
patients and is moderately reproducible in this population. Future
research is warranted to
elucidate determinants of nocturnal dipping over a short period of
time.","Table of Contents -- I- Introduction-Specific aim

College Decisions","In recent years, tax-based federal aid in the form of the Hope
and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits as well as the Tuition Deduction
has become a potential funding source for individuals interested in
pursuing higher education. This paper analyzes the relationship
between post-secondary financial aid distributed through the tax
system and the decisions to apply to college, enroll in college,
and complete a year of college for dependents between the ages of
18 and 23. Using policy variations in income and benefit limits to
estimate the aid's effects, this study finds that the amount of tax
benefit an individual is eligible to receive does not increase the
probability that an individual decides to apply to college, enroll
in college, or a complete a year of college. However, receipt of
financial aid information was found to have economically and
statistically significant effects for the three college decisions
studied, with an associated increase in the probability of
enrolling equivalent to 8.5 percentage points, an increase in the
probability of applying equivalent to 27 percentage points, and an
increase in the probability of completing a year of college
equivalent to 17 percentage points. High frequency of discussions
with parents about college attendance also resulted in significant
increases in the probabilities analyzed in this paper.","I.

the Candidate MicroRNAs that Target Oct4","Abstract

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional modulators of gene
expression that act by directly
targeting its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and play an important
role in many developmental
processes. Aberrant regulation and altered expression of specific
miRNA genes contribute to the
initiation and progression of cancer stem cells (CSC). To date,
more than 1000 human miRNAs
have been documented, but the functions of most of them remain
elusive. The main purpose of
this study is to set-up an efficient miRNA screening system of a
total of 931 human miRNAs by
combining standard transfection protocols with high throughput
screening (HTS) and high
content analysis (HCA) equipments from the Emory Chemical Biology
Discovery Center
(ECBDC). Oct4 was chosen as the initial target gene since it is an
essential transcription factor in
embryonic stem cell (ESC), as well as cancer stem cell (CSC),
development and it is a small
gene with a short 3'UTR, which allowed for easy initial set-up and
modifications of this novel
screening system. The system uses fluorescence signals, which
correlate to the targeting effects
of miRNAs on target genes, to narrow down the large miRNA library
to facilitate focused studies
with a more manageable miRNA sample size. The initial screening
identified miR-4310 and
miR-1253 as candidates that target Oct4-3'UTR. Western blotting
results verified the target
relationship of Oct4 and the miRNAs and further confirmations of
the findings by luciferase
assays and miRNA dose response curve to pDsRed2-Oct4-3'UTR will be
followed. The
identification of these miRNA candidates against Oct4 from a
library of 931 miRNAs revealed
that the new screening approach is promising and efficient,
although improvements are still
necessary to strengthen the system. Nonetheless, with the
establishment of this novel and
automatic miRNA screening system, the 3'UTR of any desired gene can
be screened for its
miRNA regulators within a reasonable time frame, while also
reducing the extensive labor,
human error, and supply cost associated with manual screenings.","Table of Contents --

TREATMENT ACT (BCCPTA) IN GEORGIA","The Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act
(BCCPTA) of 2000 allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to
uninsured women under 65, diagnosed with breast and cervical
cancers (including pre-cervical condition) through the National
Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program providers, or in
Georgia any provider, and found in need of cancer treatment.

The first article examined whether BCCPTA helped uninsured breast
cancer patients enroll in Medicaid more quickly to start treatment
at early stage. I conducted a quasi-experimental study that
compared the stage of cancer of the women aged 19-64 diagnosed with
breast cancer who were eligible for BCCPTA with those in the same
age spectrum diagnosed with one of five other cancers when they
enrol ed in Medicaid. The marginal effect of BCCPTA increased 9.5%
breast cancer cases enrolling in Medicaid at early stage
(p&lt;.1).

The second article examined how BCCPTA affected the patterns of
disenrollment from Medicaid for women diagnosed with breast,
cervical and control cancers. The post-BCCPTA period analyzed here
was one in which Georgia women could self-report that they
were in active treatment and hence, stil eligible. The unadjusted
disenrollment rate declined 50% for breast and cervical cancer
cases while it increased 30% for control cancer cases post-BCCPTA.
The direction and magnitude of results held after adjusting for
covariates that could affect disenrol ment rates.

The third article investigated cervical cancer treatment of
patients enrolled in Medicaid under BCCPTA. Of patients with
pre-cervical condition, 56% received a cancer 'work-up' while this
applied to 85% of those with an invasive condition. In terms
of
treatment combination, 75% of pre-invasive patients had a
precancerous procedure, with about 21%, versus 34 % of invasive
cases receiving surgery. Those more likely to receive surgery among
pre-invasive cases were those with more advanced stage and a
co-morbidity. Among invasive cases, later stage was associated with
higher odds of radiation/chemo but not surgery. Non-Hispanic black
were significantly less likely to have surgery than those
no-Hispanic white in both pre-invasive (p &lt; .01) and invasive
cases (p = .05).","Table of Contents --

Emergency Action Plan","Background: In the past few years, natural and man-made
emergencies have impacted
staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
working abroad,
resulting in the death of one CDC staff, two large evacuations, and
one sheltering of staff
in place. These events and many others prompted growing concerns
for the safety of
CDC staff overseas which parallels the changes in the United States
from a focus on
emergency response to one on emergency preparedness. 
Objectives: The purpose of this project is to develop an
Emergency Action Plan that
details the procedures U.S. CDC staff in China would follow to
prepare for and respond
to emergencies.

Methods: Over the course of seven weeks in Beijing, China,
interviews of unit leaders
from the U.S. CDC in China office were conducted. Lists of
essential preparedness and
response tasks for each unit of the office were drafted and
Standard Operating Procedures
were developed to outline the details of each task to aid in
cross-training and continuity
of operations.

Results: The lists of essential preparedness and response tasks
for each unit and the
Standard Operating Procedures were compiled into a 130-page
Emergency Action Plan
for the U.S. CDC in China office. Meetings were conducted with the
CDC Division of
Emergency Operations to make initial plans and identify priority
areas for a table-top
exercise to test certain components of the Emergency Action
Plan.

Discussion: The development of an Emergency Action Plan for the
U.S. CDC in China
office in the summer of 2011 was one of the first preparedness
plans to be developed for
a CDC office abroad. The Emergency Action Plan will be updated
during the summer of
2012 and expanded to include an evacuation annex. The updated
Emergency Action Plan
will be an operational document for the U.S. CDC office in China
and will be shared with
the U.S. Embassy. The biggest challenges of preparedness planning
are making it
functional and sustainable. Just as with other tools that are often
taught in Master of
Public Health programs, plans are a tool that can reduce morbidity
and mortality in
emergencies.","Table of Contents --

gain on fetal macrosomia among American Indian/Alaskan Native women","Background: The American
Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) population is at high health risk
across many health indicators, including obesity. Fetal macrosomia
can result in obstetric and long-term maternal and child
complications. We investigated the effects of prepregnancy body
mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) on macrosomia
among AI/ANs.
Methods: Data came from the Pregnancy
Risk Assessment Monitoring System in eight states from 2004-2011
for adult AI/ANs who delivered a live, singleton birth. Macrosomia
(birthweight &gt;=4,000 grams) and the World Health Organization's
BMI categories were used. GWG enumerated the pounds women deviated
from the Institute of Medicine guidelines for pregnancy weight
gain. Prevalence of macrosomia by select characteristics was
estimated. Multivariable logistic regression calculated adjusted
odds ratios (aOR) for effects of BMI and GWG, controlling for other
factors.
Results: About 30% of women were
obese, and approximately 50% had excess GWG. Prevalence of
macrosomia varied from 8.00-18.83% (Utah/Alaska). Characteristics
with significantly high prevalence of macrosomia were obesity
(16.67%), excess GWG (16.32%), multiparity (13.46%), diabetes
(17.93%), no smoking (13.54%), no nausea (13.37%), post-term
delivery (18.36%), and male infant (14.98%). There were significant
independent effects of prepregnancy obesity (aOR:1.63;
95%Confidence Interval (CI):1.29,2.07) and excess GWG (aOR:1.16;
95%CI:1.12,1.20 per five pounds gained beyond appropriate) for
macrosomia but no significant joint effects.
Conclusions: Obesity and excess GWG
are independent factors for macrosomia among AI/ANs. Culturally
appropriate interventions need to address these factors. Providers
should target all women when counseling about GWG, emphasizing the
increased risk associated with every additional pound above
recommended weight gain.","--

Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors (mGluRs) in the Mouse Striatum
","Glutamatergic transmission is the main excitatory drive within
the nervous system. Its effects are transmitted and controlled by
many types of pre- and post-synaptic receptors segregated into two
main categories based on sequence homology, structure, and signal
transduction mechanisms. The ionotropic receptors, responsible for
fast transmission, are ligand-gated ion channels. On the other
hand, metabotropic receptors (mGluRs), responsible for slower,
longer lasting effects, are G-protein-coupled receptors. The mGluRs
are further subdivided into three groups (I, II, III) based on
sequence homology, second messenger coupling and pharmacology.
Availability of research tools, pharmacoagents, and an ability to
selectively inhibit particular circuits has instigated an interest
in group III mGluRs, because these receptors can be used as
substrates for therapies alleviating symptoms in diseases
exhibiting imbalances in glutamatergic transmission, such as
Parkinson's disease. This study used high resolution electron
microscopy immunohistochemical techniques to examine the
localization and distribution of group III mGluRs in the striatum,
which is the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia circuitry. In
the striatum, group III mGluRs are shown to be localized mainly on
presynaptic elements originating from both the cortico- and
thalamo-striatal projections with significant degree of receptor
co-expression in individual terminals. The group III
mGluR-immunopositive terminals target, to a variable degree,
postsynaptic elements of both the direct and indirect pathways,
thus allowing for potential regulation of both striatofugal output
systems. However, while the mGluR4-positive terminals seem to have
a preference for the indirect pathway, the mGluR8-positive
terminals are mainly associated with the direct pathway. On the
other hand, the mGluR7-immunoreactive terminals are evenly
distributed between the two output pathways. These data provide a
map of the group III mGluRs localization along the main
glutamatregic input pathways to the striatum, thereby offer a
greater understanding of the mechanisms by which these receptors
could be mediating their regulatory effects on excitatory
transmission in the striatum and the basal ganglia. The anatomical
schematic of receptor localization will further guide the discovery
and development of pharmacoagents that can selectively activate
group III mGluRs, regulate specific neuronal circuits , and
hopefully address symptoms of numerous neurological disorders.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

published,emory:d7bvc,"Ammirati, Rachel Jeanne","Self-Assessed Emotion Recognition Skill and Social Adjustment among
College Students","Models of social information processing suggest that a
variety of perceptual and cognitive skills may interact to
influence a person's level of social adjustment (Crick &amp; Dodge,
1994). Although research has demonstrated that the ability to
accurately recognize emotional cues is important for successful
social adjustment (Nowicki, 2013; Rosenthal et al., 1979), it is
not yet known how the level of awareness of one's own emotion
recognition skill contributes to this association. That is the
purpose of the present study. Participants were 158 male and female
college students who provided self-ratings of their own facial and
vocal emotion recognition skill, personality characteristics, and
feelings of loneliness and connectedness to the social environment.
Participants' facial and vocal emotion recognition skill was
assessed via the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy, second
edition (DANVA2), and their likability was rated by their peers.
Consistent with predictions, results indicated that self-rated and
performance measures of emotion recognition skill were not
correlated strongly. When the relation between self-rated and
performance measures of emotion recognition skill was further
examined, some patterns consistent with the Dunning-Kruger effect
(Dunning, 2011) emerged, such that the poorest performers
overestimated their actual skills in contrast to top performers who
underestimated their actual skills. Findings also suggested that
more inaccurate self-ratings of actual facial emotion recognition
skill (i.e., larger discrepancies between actual and self-rated
performance) were associated with poorer social adjustment, even
after controlling for relevant personality characteristics and
performance on the DANVA2. However, this latter finding emerged
only for men. It was concluded that future research should focus on
why awareness of one's own emotion recognition skill may be more
important for men.","Introduction

Apartheid-Era Namibia, 1950-1980","During the Cold War and era of global decolonization, South Africa
attempted to
formally annex Namibia, its League of Nations Mandate. When the
National Party
government came to power in South Africa in 1948, it sought to
implement apartheid
policies in the territory. By masking apartheid as ""development,""
the South African
government hoped to gain international and United Nations approval
of its racially
discriminatory policies. The state also intended development to
justify its contested
presence in Namibia and to silence African opposition to South
African rule and
apartheid. This dissertation explores how competing forces of
decolonization and
apartheid coalesced around intra-Herero identity and water politics
in rural Namibia
between 1950 and 1980. Oral and archival sources illuminate how
local disputes over
ethnicity and water control became powerfully fused with global
decolonization
struggles, apartheid, and Cold War tensions. This dissertation not
only considers how
these larger forces shaped rural Herero society, but also
demonstrates the ways in
which parochial ethnic and development politics profoundly
influenced the ways in
which regional and international issues such as race, democracy,
and globalization
impacted the uncertain process of decolonization. By examining the
entanglement of
rural Herero identity politics, apartheid state formation, and
decolonization at the
United Nations, this dissertation provides new insights into the
ways that local people
negotiated the interstices of local-global and ethno-racial
political nexuses and
attempted to claim sovereignty over their lives, lands, and futures

Developing Critical Inner Literacy: Reading the Body, the Word,

By Chelsea A. Jackson
This qualitative research case study analyzes the lived stories
and experiences of Black Girls and Women of Color who participated
in a two week Yoga, Literature, and Art (YLA) Camp at a Women's
Historically Black College (HBCU) in the southeastern region of the
United States. Utilizing Critically Conscious Research
Methodologies, this case study was structured to engage the
following research questions:
1. What might we learn by inquiring into how Black girls'
perceptions of identity intersect and contradict their lived
experiences when yoga and culturally responsive literature are used
for mediums of learning?
2. How might inquiring into the lived stories and experiences of
Black girls and Women of Color deepen our understandings of the
cultural, institutional, and social narratives that shape
learning?
3. How might narrative inquiry, critical literacy, and yoga be
brought together to create an embodied and liberating pedagogy that
honors lived experience?
This qualitative research focuses on the work I did last summer
with 13 Black teen girls and nine adult Women of Color who
practiced yoga, discussed poetry by Women of Color throughout the
Diaspora, and shared lived experiences through art and poetry. This
work lends itself to advocates for social justice, educators, and
practitioners of yoga. Moreover, this research offers culturally
responsive teaching techniques for yoga teachers interested in
working with marginalized youth.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- INTRODUCTION 1 -- CHAPTER 1: STATEMENT OF THE

published,emory:brbk7,"Bodager, Jonathan R","Eco-epidemiology of diarrheal disease with an emphasis on
Cryptosporidium in and around Ranomafana National Park,
Madagascar","Purpose: Pathogens transmitted between
wildlife, livestock, and humans pose a serious threat to human
health and wildlife conservation. Although much is known about the
basic biology of zoonotic pathogens, the ecology and epidemiology
of their transmission between species has received less attention.
Likewise, for clinical syndromes such as diarrheal disease, the
contribution of novel zoonotic transmission relative to
human-to-human transmission on overall disease burden is unknown.
This project examined the eco-epidemiology of diarrheal disease in
rural Madagascar, with an emphasis on
Cryptosporidium, one of the most common diarrhea-causing
zoonotic parasitic genera in the world.
Methods: In July and August 2011, 278
fecal samples were collected from humans, livestock, and wildlife
from Ambodiaviavy and Ankialo, two communities near Ranomafana
National Park, Madagascar. Human subjects (n=135) were surveyed for
socio-demographic (sex, age, profession, etc.) and health data
(diarrheal illness, medication usage, water usage, etc.). DNA was
extracted from samples, screened for Cryptosporidium by 18S
PCR of the SSU, rRNA gene and subtyped using RFLP and genomic
sequencing. Chi-square tests of association were used to examine
relationships among factors from the survey instrument.
Results: A greater number of diarrheal
symptoms occurred in Ambodiaviavy than Ankialo (23.1% vs. 4.2%)
with 67% of cases younger than 18 years. Other behavioral practices
varied across communities, i.e. - drinking boiled water
(Ambodiaviavy = 52.3% reporting ‘often'; Ankialo = 58.6%
reporting ‘never'). There were a total of 41 (14.7%) positive
Cryptosporidium samples (20.2% from Ambodiaviavy and 12.5%
from Ankialo). Species prevalence of Cryptosporidium was:
0.8% of humans, 4.0% lemurs, 33.3% peri-domestic rodents, 29.0%
bovine, and 23.5% of porcine (one positive canine, n=1). Subtyping
revealed a diverse array of Cryptosporidium
species.
Conclusion: Survey data indicates
differing behavioral practices between communities that were not
linked to increased diarrhea but suggest varying risks of zoonotic
transmission across the human-animal interface. One human, infected
with C. suis, suggests a potential risk for human-pig
transmission in Ankialo, whereas, large numbers of infected cattle
in Ambodiaviavy suggest a potential risk for human-cattle
transmission. Public health efforts should focus on improving
sanitation and hygiene and on rational modifications of daily
practices to avoid zoonotic transmission.","-- TABLE OF CONTENTS --

ABSTRACT 
Overweight and Diabetes among the U.S. Foreign-Born  

By 
Reena Oza-Frank 
 
In 2007, the U.S. foreign-born population reached
a record of 38 million (13% of 
the
population). Previous research has shown that foreign-born individuals are generally 

in better health
compared to native born. However, health
outcomes such as overweight 
and diabetes have been largely understudied among immigrants despite
these conditions 
being at the forefront of public
health concern.  
 
Using nationally representative data, we
estimated the magnitude of overweight 
and diabetes among the U.S. foreign-born
and examined the relationships between 
migrant-specific characteristics and these
conditions. We found considerable 
heterogeneity in both
prevalence of overweight and diabetes by region of birth. We found 

that overweight prevalence is consistently
associated with length
of residence and that 
immigrants who arrive at younger ages are
more likely to be
overweight with increasing 
length
of residence than immigrants who arrive at later ages. In addition, depending on 

region of birth, length of U.S. exposure
appears to have a
differential impact on 
overweight prevalence. 
Diabetes prevalence increases with longer length of residence, 

independent of age and obesity, and
this relationship is consistent across different ages��at 

immigration. 
Finally, using Asian Americans as a case
study, we further show the 
importance of specific country of birth in highlighting
heterogeneity when examining 
overweight and diabetes.  
 
The
U.S. foreign-born population comes from a
range of countries, creating a 
multicultural society with multifaceted needs, not to mention the
different genetics and 
 
 
cultures that interplay with
the environment in
potentially diverse ways. 
Our findings 
contribute to the understanding of migration
and health, specifically in
the context of 
overweight and diabetes.  Public health
prevention efforts will
be improved by 
responding in
the following ways: promoting healthy lifestyles soon after migration to 

prevent excess weight gain; tailoring interventions to
target young immigrants; and 
responding to
the needs of diverse immigrants by tailoring interventions to be specific by 

place of birth.

published,emory:7tpt8,"Jia, Jenny","The Future of Dais: Traditional birth attendants and
biomedical cultural change in Matlab, Bangladesh","In developing countries, the traditional birth attendant (TBA)
plays an important role in maternal and infant health as the most
accessible resource for women. International agencies recommend
investing limited resources in training skilled birth attendants
(SBAs) rather than TBAs, although this recommendation is contested.
The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research,
Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) has been involved with maternal health in the
rural community of Matlab since 1977, and their approach supports
SBAs, facility birth, and biomedical practices while excluding
TBAs. In two years, facility deliveries have increased rapidly from
48 percent to 68 percent, and childbirth has moved from the
traditional home to the modern hospital. Yet, TBAs, locally called
dais, are still active in Matlab. The objectives of
this study were to determine the current practice of Matlab
dais, explore potential future roles of dais in formal healthcare, and reveal local perceptions of
home and facility birth. We conducted interviews with dais, community health research workers, support persons,
and ICDDR,B research investigators, all obstetrical healthcare
providers. Through interviews, I observed that dais
valued their practice for the skills they gained and for the
respect and good treatment they received from community members
rather than for material benefits. Knowledge and trainings seemed
empowering to dais, and many wished for additional
training, which positively influenced their reputations. The
current practices of dais exhibited biomedical
influences, yet ICDDR,B workers continued to view dais as problematic and egotistical, unable to change their
ways, and utilizing risky practices. Residents' perceptions of home
and facility birth showed that multiple considerations were
involved in deciding the location of birth, and although facility
birth was largely preferred over home birth, interest in each
method still existed. Dais' wishes for more
training, their preoccupation with their reputations--determined
greatly by the outcome of deliveries they performed, and evidence
that facility birth could not satisfy all the concerns of residents
suggests that a medically plural system of childbirth may be
appropriate. Both systems could be kept in check through healthy
competition and collaboration. Beliefs and practices of dais have changed to incorporate biomedical principles.
ICDDR,B should explore these changes and consider the possibility
of partnerships with dais in Matlab.","-- List of Tables and Figures -- Glossary of Acronyms and Local

  arbitrary length, have been performed using a novel sampling method to add or remove multiple monomers during a single MC move. Systems with two different persistence lengths and a range of bond
  association constants have been studied. We find first-order lyotropic phase transitions between isotropic and nematic phases near the concentrations predicted by a statistical thermodynamic
  theory, but with significantly narrower coexistence regions. A possible contribution to the discrepancy between theory and simulation is that the length distribution of chains in the nematic phase
  is bi-exponential, differing from the simple exponential distribution found in the isotropic phase and predicted from a mean-field treatment of the nematic. The additional short length-scale
  characterizing the distribution appears to arise from the lower orientational order of short chains. The dependence of this length-scale on chemical potential, bond association constant, and total
  monomer concentration has been examined.  Using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations we study the equilibrium properties of actin self-assembly. The statistics of actin
  polymerization is described by a mechanism involving monomer activation and chain propagation with bond association constants derived from experimental free energy parameters. For
  efficiency in representing systems of extremely long, stiff chains we use a coarse-graining based on spherocylinders. We present results pertaining to the isotropic-nematic transition in this

  separation results in an equilibrium between a bundle and isotropic short chains. The chain length distribution of the phase separated system, as well as the bundle's shape and aspect ratio, etc.

Relation between tooth loss and tobacco usage:
Findings from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System. Nirmal Shah B.D.S., Pamela Mink M.P.H, PhD

ABSTRACT
Background
Smoking cigarettes is associated with increased tooth loss; however
research
establishing an association between the number of teeth removed and
cigarette
smoking status as well as smokeless tobacco use status is limited.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the
association between the number of teeth lost and tobacco use
(cigarette smoking status
and smokeless tobacco use status) in the US adult population.
Methods
We used data from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System to
examine the association between self-reported tobacco use
(cigarette smoking status
and smokeless tobacco use status) and number of teeth removed. We
estimated the prevalence estimates for
each of the selected covariates by the number teeth removed as well
as tobacco use
,and also evaluated the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
by using multivariate logistic regression
model.
5
Results
In this US adult sample, 31.5% reported removing 1-5 teeth and 11%
reported
removing 6 or more (but not all) teeth. Respondents who reported
""currently""
smoking cigarettes had a significantly higher prevalence of 6 or
more (but not all) teeth
removed when compared to respondents who reported ""never"" smoking
cigarettes
(16% vs. 7% ""current"" and ""never"" smokers respectively). In a
multivariate
logistic regression model adjusting for selected covariates,
respondents who reported
""currently"" smoking cigarettes were 3.5 times as likely to have 6
or more (but not
all) teeth removed than respondents who reported ""never"" smoking
cigarettes.
Respondents who reported being ""former"" cigarette smokers were 2.2
times as
likely to have 6 or more (but not all) teeth removed than
respondents who reported
""never"" smoking cigarettes. The odds of having lost 6 or more (but
not all) teeth
among ""current"" smokeless tobacco users were similar to those who
reported ""never""
using smokeless tobacco (OR= 1.1, 95% CI= 1.1 to 1.2).
Conclusion
A strong association was observed between cigarette smoking and
number of teeth
removed due to infection. Multidisciplinary efforts are needed to
raise awareness of
the effects of tobacco on tooth loss. Regular dental examinations
with periodic dental
scaling are important for preventing tooth loss.","9 -- TABLE OF CONTENTS -- 1.

ENS Development","Investigation of the Functional Role of BMP Signaling in ENS
Development
The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is the set of neurons and glia
that comprises the
nervous system in your intestine, allowing for complex control of
gastrointestinal (GI)
function. A properly constructed ENS requires sufficient
proliferation followed by
appropriate differentiation of these enteric precursors, which all
derive from an axial
population of cells called the vagal neural crest. If the
precursors fail to populate the gut
in sufficient numbers and fail to differentiate into the
appropriate neuronal and glial
subtypes, it can cause various congenital disorders, one of which
is Hirschsprung's
(HSCR) Disease. HSCR is a pediatric developmental disorder
occurring in approximately
1:5000 live births. The genetic basis of HSCR is only partially
understood. To identify
new HSCR genes we utilize the zebrafish model system. Previously
the Shepherd lab
identified a zebrafish ENS mutant with an HSCR-like phenotype that
was named lessen
( lsn). In subsequent analysis of this mutant, a number of
components of the Bone
Morphogenic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway were differentially
expressed. The BMP
pathway is known to be involved in various developmental processes
and has been
implicated in ENS development. Given these results we aimed to
determine the spatial
and temporal expression pattern of the BMP ligands in the
developing zebrafish intestine
by in situ hybridizations. We then determined the effect of
inhibiting BMP signaling on
zebrafish ENS development. We find that treatment with a small
molecule inhibitor of
the BMP pathway, DMH1 at stages of ENS development when neural
precursors would
normally be differentiating, causes an increase in the number of
enteric neurons at
120hpf. We propose a model of BMP-regulated ENS development in
which BMP
signaling determines different developmental choices depending on
the amount of BMP
signaling in the intestine at specific developmental stages. Early
in zebrafish ENS
development low levels of BMP signaling maintain ENS precursors in
a proliferative state
while levels of BMP signaling at later stages of ENS development
causes precursor differentiation.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1-12 -- Gastrointestinal Tract 1

Evening the Score: Factors Affecting Criminal Responses to
Injustice
By Heather L. Scheuerman
Research in criminology suggests that some, but not all stressors
or strains increase
criminal or deviant behavior. The literature indicates that
criminal or deviant acts are
more likely in response to strains that are perceived to be unjust.
It is not clear, however,
how different types of injustice combine to affect these behaviors.
To address this
limitation, I examine how certain types and combinations of major
forms of injustice
(distributive, procedural, and interactional) may increase the
likelihood that individuals
respond to strain with crime. In addition, this project examines
how factors such as
gender, personality traits, and peers' endorsement of criminal or
deviant behavior
condition whether individuals respond to injustice with crime or
deviance. I argue that
injustice will most likely promote crime when multiple forms of
injustice coincide and
when unjust events entail the experience of disrespect and improper
treatment (i.e.,
interactional injustice). This form of injustice may be perceived
as more severe relative to
distributive and procedural injustice because of the intense
emotional and behavioral
responses it produces. To test these arguments, undergraduate study
participants
responded to three vignettes by indicating how likely they would be
to engage in criminal
or deviant behavior in response to the strain represented in each
vignette. Results reveal
that multiple forms of injustice are not necessary to produce
criminal or deviant
responses to a distributive injustice, one type is sufficient.
Also, males are more likely
than females to engage in crime or deviance in response to this
form of injustice.

Ethic of Solidarity","By posting a nude image of herself, Aliaa Magda Elmahdy began a
movement that seeks
to incorporate the nude body into political life in Egypt. While
there are countless
differences between the now over forty images on her post, they
each play a role in

subject. ""Revolting
Revolution: Aliaa Magda Elmahdy and the Crafting of an Ethic of
Solidarity"" seeks to
understand how it is this political action occurred, as well as
what possible benefits
there are from projects like Elmahdy's. To understand her work,
this paper begins by
first investigating the meaning behind revolution. It determines
that revolution does not
necessarily bring about change, and instead, often the same power
dynamics remain in
place. Despite this, there are moments of revolt that society seeks
to expel from politics
by describing them as disgusting or disturbing. These instances are
the ones that this
paper will identify as having the capacity to change society.
Elmahdy's images serve as
an instance of this sort of revolt. The second half of this
discussion focuses on the
particular images on her blog. In particular, it investigates the
role of the female lips and
in Elmahdy's political project. With the help of Luce Irigaray,
this paper seeks to show
the way that Elmahdy's images function as a type of feminine speech
that move away
from the stability focus of status quo politics in Egypt. Instead,
they open up space for a
chaotic understanding of citizenship by establishing an ethic of
solidarity where the
images are able to unite individuals despite their differences.
This process occurs
through a proliferation of differences where each individual begins
to see that despite
their inevitable differences, there is no justification to maintain
the exclusion others.","Table of Contents -- I. Introduction

Control of Sun-Protective Behaviors in Intercollegiate Student
Athletes","The purpose of this mixed methods study was to explore how
attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of
sun-protective behaviors (SPB) affected intention to practice SPB
in an intercollegiate student athlete population. Guided by the
Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), it examined these factors in
depth to understand why intercollegiate student athletes currently
report high levels of sun exposure but low levels of sun protection
compared to non-athlete peers. A paper and pencil survey and two
gender-specific focus groups with male and female tennis players
(n=11) were conducted at a private university in Georgia. Data were
collected and analyzed for deductive and inductive codes based on
the TPB constructs. Overall, women reported higher average
intention and subjective norm scores, indicating stronger intention
to practice SPB and more supportive norms for practicing SPB by
coaches and teammates. However, men indicated higher instrumental
attitude scores, indicating the men had more favorable attitudes
toward using SPB than the women. Men also indicated more control
over and less difficulty with practicing SPB on average than the
women, all though women indicated that SPB was less time consuming
than men indicated. These findings were supported within the focus
groups, with intention relating to burns athletes' or their
teammates had experienced or would experience in the coming season.
Attitudes toward SPB related to appearance, convenience, SPB and
the athletes' ability to play, and avoiding pain from sunburns.
Subjective norms were influenced by future health concerns, the
normative health behaviors of others, and support from family,
coaches and peers concerning SPB. Perceived behavioral control
concerned individual control versus institutional control, and what
behaviors were possible to practice according to the participants.
The idea of context surrounding SPB emerged, specifically related
the physical location where sun exposure occurred, the intensity of
the sun exposure, and what other behaviors were prioritized over
SPB. The results of this study add to the literature for
qualitative studies of young adult athletes and intention to
practice SPB. Public health practitioners can use the findings here
to inform future research and to create more targeted interventions
to increase SPB in college athletes.","Table of Contents -- Chapter One: Introduction --

","Abstract

Cells regulate immediate early
gene expression levels by adjusting the rates of gene transcription
and mRNA decay. Initially, significant emphasis was placed on the
role of transcriptional regulation in these responses following
cell signaling, but recent evidence increasingly suggests
regulation also occurs at the post-transcriptional level.
Determining what processes contribute to experimentally observed
changes in RNA stability presents a significant challenge. The goal
of this work was to provide an improved understanding of how cells
couple extracellular signaling events to changes in RNA metabolism.
The first phase of this research set out to evaluate the ability of
existing methods to identify trans-acting proteins
that interact specifically with known functional cis-acting RNA regulatory elements. Several methods were
stringently tested including multiple RNA immunoprecipitation
techniques and a yeast 3 hybrid screen. For all methods, results of
specificity assessment experiments revealed serious limitations. In
a first effort to address this specificity problem, I chose to take
a more functional approach by testing whether the S.
cerevisiae GPCR-controlled mating pathway makes use of
post-transcriptional regulation to alter steady-state RNA levels.
The ability to model this type of regulated stability in yeast
would not only allow for the identification of novel
post-transcription factors, but it would also expand the repertoire
of approaches to discover the specific processes targeted by
signaling to effect the observed changes in RNA turnover. Since my
data indicate that S. cerevisiae apparently lacks
this mode of regulation, it was feasible to build a novel system
that could be used to identify new proteins that interact with
functional signal-regulated RNA elements. I therefore developed and
deployed a novel yeast-based screening system that is capable of
detecting the interaction between functional RNA cis-elements and candidate RNA binding proteins. The true
value and novelty of this system is that it can read out a genetic
interaction without prejudice to the mechanism of
post-transcriptional regulation. Using this system, I have
identified a novel interacting protein for the COX2 mRNA and have
contributed to our understanding of how cells couple extracellular
signaling events to changes in RNA metabolism.","Table of Contents --  -- Chapter 1: Introduction.

that the American Indian population is not a homogenous group, the
objective of this study is to identify and describe the prevalence

population in order to decrease the cesarean section rate.
Methods: The study is a retrospective review of 809
consecutive deliveries in 2011 at Cherokee Nation Hastings Hospital
in northeastern Oklahoma. Data were analyzed to describe the
incidence of cesarean section, diabetes, hypertension, body mass
index at delivery, pre-pregnancy body mass index, induction of
labor, and ethnicity. Odds ratios were calculated for cesarean
section and birth weight greater than 4000 grams using diabetes,
hypertension, Cherokee descent, obesity at delivery, morbid obesity
at delivery, induction, and gestational age. Results: The
results showed comparable rates of diabetes and obesity in relation
to population data on American Indians. Rates of induction of labor
and cesarean section were higher than the national average. The
strongest predictors for cesarean section were morbid obesity at
delivery, hypertension and obesity at delivery. The strongest
predictors for birth weight greater than 4000 grams were
gestational age of 40+ weeks, diabetes, and morbid obesity at
delivery. Conclusion: Maternal characteristics do not
distinguish this patient population served by Hastings Hospital
from population data on US American Indians. Decreasing the
cesarean section rate will require a combined approach of sustained
public health measures to address pre-conception health and
clinical interventions during prenatal care.","Contents -- Abbreviations -- Acknowledgments --

published,emory:pk43p,"Guest, Lauren Taylor",Ebola Virus Disease in 2015: A Epidemiological History,"This thesis explores the epidemiological history of Ebola Virus
Disease (EVD) since it was discovered in 1976. By far the largest
ever epidemic of EVD appears to be drawing to a close in West
Africa. However, it has entered the most difficult stage--that of
total elimination of all Ebola cases in the human population. This
is difficult given the remoteness of many communities, their poor
access to health services and transportation concerns. However, the
region contains more hospital beds, laboratories and health staff
than it ever did prior to the epidemic--this fact, combined with
the treatment and vaccine trials currently underway in areas where
weekly case numbers are still high, finally hints at an end to an
epidemic that infected over 25,000 people.
The West African Ebola epidemic had devastating consequences on
the region both in terms of lives lost and economic impacts.
Therefore, it is even more imperative that the lessons learned
should serve to reduce the magnitude and scope of future Ebola and
other infectious disease epidemics. These include: 1) aggressive
treatment including life-support measures can improve survival in
some patients, 2)the importance of an immediate and efficient
response by UN agencies, and 3) increased awareness of the
importance of improving health systems in low resource countries to
prevent and control future epidemics.
Researchers who worked on an Ebola epidemic in Uganda several
years prior to the West African epidemic concluded that there was a
major need for improved surveillance, reporting and diagnostics to
prevent further epidemics of this deadly virus. Their advice went
unheeded, but perhaps the devastation of many West African
communities will allow appropriate distribution of financial and
personnel resources to prevent such an epidemic in the future. The
West African Ebola response has fostered new partnerships between
pharmaceutical companies, researchers and governmental
organizations to develop and push through promising treatment and
vaccine candidates for Ebola. Although many of these will come too
late to be of much use in the current epidemic, they have the
potential to protect high-risk communities in Central and West
Africa from future Ebola epidemics.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Introduction

giant protein UNC-89 (obscurin) in C. elegans muscle","Sarcomeres, highly ordered assemblages of hundreds of proteins,
perform the work of
muscle contraction. Despite increasing knowledge of sarcomere
components and their
functions, we still do not have a clear understanding about how
sarcomeres are assembled
and maintained during muscle contraction. Our laboratory studies
sarcomere assembly in
the model genetic organism C. elegans, focusing on the
function of the giant muscle
protein UNC-89. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which
UNC-89 is
assembled at the M-line, and how UNC-89 performs its functions, our
laboratory is
identifying its binding partners, and studying their
functions.
My thesis focused on finding binding partners for two regions of
UNC-89: the C-
terminal protein kinase region, and the N-terminal Ig domains 1-5.
I discovered that the
PK1 protein kinase domain and interkinase region interact with
LIM-9 (FHL in humans),
and that LIM-9 interacts with SCPL-1, a CTD type phosphatase,
previously identified by
the lab as interacting with the kinase domains of UNC-89. I propose
two structural
models for the function of these interactions at the M-line.
I have discovered a new binding partner for the N-terminal region
of UNC-89, called
CPNA-1. CPNA-1 contains a conserved ""copine domain"" with weak
homology to the
extracellular portions of integrins, and largely unknown function.
I have defined a new
category of copine domain containing proteins, the ""atypical"" ones.
CPNA-1 specific
antibodies localize to integrin adhesion complexes (M-lines and
dense bodies) of
nematode body wall muscle. I found that CPNA-1 binds to the M-line
proteins UNC-89,
LIM-9 (FHL), SCPL-1, UNC-96, and a protein common to the M-line and
dense body,
PAT-6 (actopaxin). A genomic deletion for cpna-1, gk266,
displays the typical Pat
(Paralyzed arrested at two-fold) phenotype. By localizing
previously characterized
muscle adhesion complex proteins in cpna-1 mutant embryos,
and localizing CPNA-1 in
other Pat mutants, I have placed CPNA-1 in the M-line/dense body
assembly pathway of
embryonic muscle. By using RNAi and mutants, I have begun to define
a role for CPNA-
1 in adult muscle. I conclude with a model that PAT-6 recruits
CPNA-1, and in turn,
CPNA-1 recruits additional proteins (UNC-89, LIM-9, SCPL-1, UNC-96)
to the M-line.","Table of Contents -- 1. Chapter 1: Introduction -- 1.1

The Evolution of Pride: Do the Chimpanzee Bluff Display and Human
Pride Expression Share Evolutionary Origins?
By Sara A. Price

Recent studies of pride suggest that it has a prototypical,
universally recognized expression: a small smile, head tilted back,
expanded chest, and arms akimbo or raised above the head.
Primatologists have suggested that similar behaviors occur in the
chimpanzee bluff display. This paper aims to assess shared
evolutionary origins by comparing the morphological similarities
between the chimpanzee bluff display and the human pride
expression.

Data were collected from captive chimpanzees (Pan
troglodytes) at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Displays were
coded for behavioral elements according to an ethogram, the
situational context in which the behavior occurred, and whether
display interactions resulted in the receipt of submissive
behavior. A factor analysis was performed on the data to reveal
which behavioral elements co-occurred with the greatest frequency.
The factor scores were analyzed using Univariate ANOVAs to
determine whether there were significant differences in the factor
scores for behaviors across each social context.

The factor analysis revealed four factors, which we identified as
different types of displays. The ""bipedal bluff"" (speed and
intensity of raising two arms, bipedal running) was ubiquitous
across all contexts. The ""attack display"" (one or two arms raised,
hitting other individuals, jumping, running quadrupedally) was
associated with dyadic interactions against females and was the
only display type that received submission. The ""pant hoot bluff
display"" (puckered lips, pout moans, rising and climax pant hoots,
hitting inanimate objects) was associated with solo displays. The
""aggressive bluff"" (bulging lip face, hitting inanimate objects,
intense stomping, jumping) was associated with group displays. The
combination of bipedal posture with arms raised, which loaded
highly in the ""bipedal bluff"" and appeared in the ""attack display,""
is similar to components seen in the prototypical human pride
expression. Male chimpanzees may use these behaviors to assert
dominance and force submission from females, reinforcing status.
Overall, these results suggest that a group of behavioral
components found in the chimpanzee bluff display may have evolved
into the human pride expression.","Table of Contents --

Outcome","In the U.S., Black and Hispanic children with cancer are less
likely to survive than White children. In acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), Black race and Hispanic ethnicity have, likewise, been
associated with a poor prognosis. It remains unclear, however,
whether the association between race/ethnicity and outcome, could
be explained by differences in other relevant variables, such as
socioeconomic status (SES), age, obesity, and disease
characteristics, or whether the association is simply due to worse
outcome following stem cell transplant (SCT), often included in AML
treatment, and known to be inferior for Black and Hispanic
patients. In order to examine these and other potential explanatory
variables, we did a secondary analysis of the data collected during
the Children's Oncology Group phase 3 clinical trial AAML0531. The
primary outcome was event-free survival (EFS), censored at the time
of per-protocol SCT. We hypothesized an association between
race/ethnicity and response to chemotherapy and survival; and
moreover, that it would be explained by racial/ethnic differences
in patient characteristics such as weight and SES and disease
characteristics such as the presence of risk-stratifying
cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities. A total of 1022 patients were
included in the analysis, but only 914 could be classified into one
of 4 meaningful racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, Asian,
Hispanic-White). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed
significantly worse 5-year EFS for Black patients compared to White
(39.07% Â± 4.89 vs 50.84% Â± 2.23; p=0.035);
however, there was no difference in remission or relapse rate
between groups. In the multivariate analysis, controlling for age,
cytogenetic/molecular disease characteristics, weight, and SES did
not affect the association between Black race and poor EFS
(HR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.10-2.00; p=0.009). Surprisingly, Black patients
had significantly worse treatment related mortality (TRM) compared
to White (15.21% Â± 3.54 vs 5.66% Â± 1.01;
p=0.0006), although no consistent cause of death was identified.
Therefore, we conclude that the poor outcome for Black children
with AML treated on this regimen is due to excess TRM and not due
to baseline differences in disease characteristics, response to
therapy, or complications from SCT. Future research should be aimed
at determining the underlying reason for this observation.","Introduction 1-3 -- Background 4-8 -- Methods 9-17 -- Results 18-22

Western poetic traditions
while simultaneously criticizing the governmental, artistic, and

changes in migration on semi-solid media. We also discuss
complications of this method and present potential solutions to
surmount these limitations. Chapter 4 discusses studies toward
overcoming our previously unproductive efforts to identify
synthetic riboswitches that could repress bacterial gene expression
when a small-molecule ligand is provided. These studies revealed a
novel mechanism by which synthetic riboswitches may function in
E. coli cells. In Chapter 5, we present principles
to introduce synthetic riboswitches into a diverse set of
prokaryotes. For species lacking dynamic inducible promoter
systems, the introduction of synthetic riboswitch technologies will
facilitate previously intractable genetic and biochemical
studies.
Part II focuses on our efforts to
develop ‘smart' materials that sense specific chemical
signals in complex environments and respond with predictable
changes in their mechanical properties. Toward this end, we
developed a genetic toolbox of natural and engineered protein
modules that can be rationally combined in many ways to create
reversible self-assembling materials that vary in their
composition, architecture, and mechanical properties.
Using this toolbox, we produced and characterized
several materials that reversibly self-assemble in the presence of
calcium ions. The properties of these materials could be predicted
from the dilute solution behavior of their component modules,
suggesting that this toolbox may be generally useful for creating
new stimuli-sensitive materials.","Part I: Discovery and Applications of Small-Molecule Dependent

Government","This dissertation examines women's pathways to powerful
positions in municipal government and whether cities respond to
women's interests in policymaking. In recent years, a growing
number of women have been elected to city government. In light of
this trend, the project addresses several questions: Why is the
presence and power of women in municipal government greater in some
U.S. cities than others? Does the increasing numerical
representation of women in city government make any difference? Do
cities where women hold positions of authority have more
women-friendly policies?
Part I examines how variation in the political contexts of
cities affects women's election as council members and mayors and
their ascendance to prominent positions in municipal government. In
Chapter 2, I analyze an original dataset of large American cities
to extend the reach of our knowledge about women's presence as
mayors and council members. In Chapter 3, I trace the process
whereby women have gained increasingly prominent positions in the
governments of Atlanta, Georgia and Houston, Texas since the
1970s.
Part II investigates the policy impact of women's presence and
power in municipal government. In Chapters 4 and 5, I employ
statistical analyses to examine whether women's presence and power
of women in government influences how cities allocate funding in
the federal Community Development Block Grant program and also
whether they adopt a symbolic platform to strengthen families and
improve neighborhoods. Throughout Part II, I draw on original
fieldwork in Houston and Atlanta, including close to 50 interviews
with municipal officials and civic leaders, to probe the findings
from the statistical analyses and explore outstanding puzzles.","Chapter 1. Introduction 1 -- Part I. The Determinants of Women's

Consciousness and Procreative Responsibility","Background: Approximately half of all
pregnancies and 35-37% of all births are
unintended in the US. Unintended
pregnancies and births are associated with negative consequences
for the mother, father, and child. Relatively few studies have
incorporated the preferences of men, despite the knowledge that
they do have an influence on reproductive decisions. Men's ideas
about virility, child-bearing desires, and the responsibility they
feel for initiating or preventing conception could affect
unintended pregnancy rates.
Aims: Using William Marsiglio's conceptual
framework describing men's procreative identities, I investigate
how men's senses of procreative consciousness (PC) and
procreative responsibility (PR) affect their risk of fathering an
unintended birth (UIB) and how differences in the
expression of PC and PR among demographic groups help to account
for disparities in UIB rates.
Methods: In this mixed methods project, I
use the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to examine the
impact that different measures of PC and PR have on a man's
likelihood of fathering an UIB. On the qualitative side, I analyze
the transcripts of focus groups conducted with young,
socioeconomically disadvantaged African American and Puerto Rican
men to examine how men who have demonstrated high rates of UIB talk
about PC, PR, and pregnancy planning.
Results: Analyses of NSFG data reveal that
certain aspects of PC and PR have statistically significant effects
on the probability that a man fathered an UIB. However,
socio-demographic measures (e.g. age, educational attainment, and
marital status) still exert an important effect on men's risk for
UIB. Analyses of the transcripts demonstrate that men often have a
very active sense of PC and a lagging sense of PR, at least in
terms of responsibility for pregnancy prevention. However, men
consider fatherhood to be an important role and look forward to
parenting children. These factors may contribute to their
relatively higher risk for an UIB.
Conclusions: My project demonstrates that
men do play a role in unintended pregnancy and birth through their
values, attitudes, and behaviors towards reproduction. However, the
socio-structural position of men in society still has a large,
independent impact on a man's risk of fathering an
UIB.","Chapter 1: Introduction 1 -- Chapter 2: Methods 49 -- Table 2.1:

Environmental Factors on Fecal Testosterone and Fecal
Glucocorticoid Levels in Wild Female Verreaux's Sifaka
(Propithecus verreauxi)","The study of female competition in non-human primates has
generated more attention over recent years and placed an increased
focus on the proximate and ultimate causes of female competitive
behavior. When contest competition for available resources is high,
females form linear dominance hierarchies, which may result in
rank-related differences in feeding efficiency, nutrient intake,
and reproductive success. The field of socioendocrinology provides
the opportunity to examine inter-individual differences in hormonal
responses to social factors that may reflect the relative costs of
social rank. Research across species of primates has investigated
the extent to which dominance and competitive behavior are mediated
by hormones associated with aggression (androgens) and stress
(glucocorticoids). Despite these advances, relatively few of these
studies have examined the relationships among dominance,
aggression, and hormonal measures in wild female primates.
The goal of this study was to examine female competitive
behavior within an endocrinological framework by assessing the
extent to which dominance rank and aggression are mediated by
androgens and glucocorticoids in wild female Verreaux's sifaka
(Propithecus verreauxi), a lemuroid primate living in
southwest Madagascar. Behavioral and hormonal data were collected
on eight adult female sifaka with infants from July through
December 2007 at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar.
The results showed that neither dominance rank nor rates of
aggression were significant predictors of fecal testosterone (fT)
or fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) levels. However, male immigration and
infanticide events had a profound effect on both hormonal measures.
Females in groups that experienced male takeover events had
significantly higher fT and fGC levels compared to females in
stable groups. There was a strong seasonal effect on aggressive
behavior, suggesting that contest competition increases during the
period of resource abundance for female sifaka and that dominance
relationships may be seasonally dependent. Fecal glucocorticoid
levels dropped significantly after the first rainfall of the
season, demonstrating that the endocrine response is particularly
sensitive to exogenous cues for this species. These results
highlight the need for longitudinal studies with repeated hormonal
measures in order to assess the complex interactions of social and
ecological factors on the endocrine response in female
primates.","Table of Contents -- I. Introduction: Female Competition in

Screening Tool for Tuberculosis in HIV-infected Patients in
South-East Asia","Background: Tuberculosis and HIV are major causes of
morbidity and mortality worldwide, and TB/HIV co-infection is a
major barrier to global TB and HIV control efforts. Successful
interventions exist to control TB and HIV individually, but they
are less effective in areas where TB/HIV co-infection is prevalent
partly because TB is difficult to diagnose in immunosuppressed
persons. The World Health Organization recommends a symptom-based
clinical screening tool to help clinicians rule out TB in
HIV-infected patients and initiate appropriate treatment. To date,
the performance of this screening tool has not been evaluated
across a range of immune status.
Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a
cross-sectional study of HIV-infected patients seeking care in
Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam to evaluate the performance of the
WHO screening tool using a reference standard approach and
mycobacterial culture status as the referent. Logistic regression
modeling with piecewise linear splines was used to estimate the
sensitivity and specificity of the screening rule compared to
mycobacterial culture across a continuous range of CD4+ cell
counts, comparing the effect of immune status on the tool's
performance in persons with CD4+ cell counts above and below
400.
Results: Of 1,988 participants who underwent TB
evaluation, 276 (13.8%) had TB and 1,514 (76.2%) had at least one
of the 4 symptoms comprising the WHO screening tool. Among patients
with CD4 counts below 400, the sensitivity (AOR 0.41) and (1-
specificity) (AOR 0.765) decreased with increasing immune status.
There is no evidence of a statistically significant effect of
immune status above 400 cells on the sensitivity or specificity of
the screening tool.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that among persons
infected with HIV in South-East Asia, the WHO screening tool for TB
is more sensitive with falling immune status. The screening rule is
most effective among those with more severe immunosuppression, so
it may improve TB case-finding and treatment initiation among those
most susceptible to infection and adverse health outcomes.","1. Introduction - 1 -- 2. Literature Review - 5 -- 2.1 Introduction

Jaffna District, Sri Lanka (2009)","Introduction
Approximately 15% of the global population lives with some
form of disability. Regardless of this significant representation
in the population, little is known about the health risk factors
for those with disabilities in conflict-affected states. As the
civil war in Sri Lanka concluded in 2009, an opportunity to address
this dearth of information arose.
Objectives
To describe the characteristics of the disabled population
in post-conflict Jaffna District, Sri Lanka. Types and causes of
disabilities were assessed, as well as sociocontextual factors that
impact daily and lifetime well-being of those with disabilities.
Subgroups within the disabled population were defined and
differences between them were analyzed. Additionally, access to
water/sanitation/hygiene and food resources and experiences of
traumatic effects were analyzed in households with and without
disabled persons.
Methods
A multistage cluster survey was conducted between July and
September 2009 in Jaffna District, Sri Lanka. Of the 1494
households included in the general health survey, 172 individuals
were identified as being disabled. Frequencies and bivariate
analyses were used to describe and compare subgroups of the
disabled population and households with and without disabled
persons.
Results
The most common types of disability were experiencing
mobility problems, paralysis, blindness, and mental disability.
Common causes of disabilities were disease, congenital problems,
aging, and injury. Over 48% of the population was 60 years or
older. Comparisons of households with and without disabled persons
revealed few differences in access to water/sanitation/hygiene and
food resources. However, there were statistically significant
differences in these populations when assessing lifetime
experiences of lack of shelter, loss or destruction of property,
ill health without access to medical care, torture, and missing or
losing family members.
Conclusion
Those who provide services to the disabled population in
Jaffna District, Sri Lanka, should create specific interventions
that address the sociocontextual challenges of being disabled by
mobility problems and aging. Additionally, caregivers and others
who live with disabled persons should be considered in the
implementation of services.","-- Chapter I: Introduction and

of social context
variables may be important for understanding the link between
testosterone and
adolescent aggression and delinquency. The present research extends
previous work by
examining the interaction between testosterone and social context
within a cross-sectional
study (Study One) and within a longitudinal treatment outcome study
(Study Two).
Study One examined adolescent boys between the ages of 12 and 17
who were
participating in a larger longitudinal investigation of
Multisystemic Therapy in
community settings. Data were gathered in the context of
pre-treatment assessments, and
were analyzed to test the hypotheses that the relationship between
testosterone and
aggression and delinquency depends on (a) deviant peer group
affiliation, (b) parenting
style, and/or (c) basal cortisol levels. Results did not reveal
significant interactions
between testosterone and cortisol or between testosterone and
social context (i.e.,
parenting style and deviant peer affiliation) as predictors of
aggressive or delinquent
outcomes. Study Two extended the investigation of these variables
to a treatment context
by examining the relationship between testosterone and social
context and testosterone
and cortisol on the growth trajectories of caregiver report of
therapist adherence, youth
aggression, and youth delinquency. Study Two also examined the
co-variation between
testosterone and youth aggression and delinquency over the course
of MST treatment.
Results revealed a lower rate of positive change in caregiver
report of therapist adherence
for the youth in the sample who had both high basal cortisol levels
and high testosterone
levels at pre-treatment. Additionally, the combination of high
testosterone and high
deviant peer affiliation as well as the combination of high
testosterone and high quality
parenting at pre-treatment were associated with less of a decline
in aggression and
delinquency over the course of treatment. Last, results of Study
Two revealed a positive
association between testosterone and delinquency across time in the
MST treatment
context. Results of Study One add to the mixed literature on the
association between
testosterone and aggression and delinquency. Results of Study Two
provide novel
evidence for the role of testosterone in the prediction of future
externalizing behaviors.
Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.

Targeting Cell Survival Signaling for Therapeutic Discovery
By: Andrea Lynn Kasinski
The completion of the human genome sequence has greatly
facilitated gene profiling to reveal tumor specific signatures and
the identification of tumor-addicted oncogenes and pathways. These
advances offer unprecedented opportunities for anticancer
therapeutic discovery and development. The emerged cancer survival
signaling pathways guide our characterization of promising
therapeutic agents while lead us to novel strategies for targeting
these tumor-addicted regulatory mechanisms. By taking advantage of
these developments, my dissertation seeks (i) to understand the
mechanism of action of a natural product analog, EF24, for
anticancer therapeutic discovery and (ii) to unravel the
transcriptional control machinery of a specific member of the
14-3-3 protein family, a master regulator of cell survival
signaling, for future therapeutic interventions.
Curcumin, a natural product, has shown numerous therapeutic
benefits but suffers from low potency and poor absorption. To
overcome these limitations, a structural analog, EF24, was
developed and exhibited a potent anticancer activity. However, its
molecular target remains to be defined. My research describes a
mechanism by which EF24 potently suppresses the NF-kB
signaling pathway through direct action on the I-kB
kinase (IKK): (i) EF24 rapidly blocks the nuclear translocation of
NF-kB with a potency ten times better than that of
curcumin, (ii) EF24 effectively inhibits TNFa-induced
I-kB phosphorylation and degradation, and (iii) EF24
directly inhibits the catalytic activity of IKKb in an
in vitro reconstituted system. This study identifies IKK as
an effective target for EF24 and provides a molecular explanation
for a superior activity of EF24 over curcumin. The effective
inhibition of TNFa-induced NF-kB
signaling by EF24 extends the therapeutic application of EF24 to
other NF-kB-dependent diseases besides cancer,
including various inflammatory diseases.
Dysregulated 14-3-3 proteins have been associated with poor
survival of certain cancer populations. Targeting 14-3-3-mediated
survival signaling has emerged as a promising anticancer strategy.
However, the high level of sequence similarity among its seven
isoforms and functional redundancy pose significant challenges. My
research aims at defining the transcriptional mechanism that
specifically controls the expression of a highly oncogenic isoform,
14-3-3z ( ywhaz
). Through a series of molecular and genetic approaches, my
research identified five transcript variants of ywhaz , determined the importance of
ywhaz variant 1c, revealed a
functional CRE element within its promoter, and discovered two CREB
family members as ywhaz
transcription factors. Indeed, silencing of ATF-1, a CREB member,
resulted in reductions in two of the five variants accompanied by
significantly decreased 14-3-3z protein. This study
defines the first transcriptional regulatory system that directs
the expression of an oncogenic 14-3-3 isoform and reveals a
mechanism by which ATF-1-mediated pathways control the expression
and function of 14-3-3z and
14-3-3z-regulated signaling network.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1:

Feminist Aporetics: On Negativity and Alterity
By Emily Parker
Escalating feminist disagreement over the status of the name
""women"" locates a deeper
question of feminist subjectivity: is the feminist that which
theorizes a subjectivity that does not
yet exist (a new woman ""becoming"") or is the feminist moment
precisely in preemption or
critique of the very grounds for subjectivity? This dissertation
develops a feminist response to
Theodor Adorno by asking where the figure of Antigone, Sophocles'
tragic heroine, might be
figured in Adorno's Negative Dialectics. In doing so, I
offered an Adornian contribution to
feminist theories of subjectivity by arguing that the feminist
exists in the aporia between thinking
the political salience of the dialectic (the political opposition
of object to a presumed, neutral
subjectivity) and the immanent critique of dialectics. An
interpretation of the disagreement
among Judith Butler, Naomi Zack, Luce Irigaray regarding the
significance of Antigone's
resistance invokes the question of feminist subjectivity. In the
final three chapters, aporetic
interpretations of the feminist, that in which the feminist
consists, are explored in the work of
Simone de Beauvoir, Eve Sedgwick and Gayatri Spivak, respectively.
This project speaks to
more general questions of the political and the ethical, self and
knowledge through the
articulation of the question of subjectivity as a primary ethical
and political question.","Table of Contents -- Acknowledgements -- Introduction -- 1 --

Lessons Learned in Five New Religious Movements
","""Faith and Moral Development in Fundamentalist Religious
Communities: Lessons Learned from Five New Religious Movements"" is,
first, a work of practical theology. The practical theology
employed in this study understands religious communities as
carriers of practical reason, asking of each of them the normative
and descriptive questions: Are these communities representing the
ideals and norms of their respective traditions as carriers of
religious knowledge? In what ways are these communities
implementers of practical religious wisdom and what is it that this
wisdom teaches?
Second, this study represents an effort to take seriously
subcultures of fundamentalist New Religious Movements (fNRMs). It
is a response to prevailing theories of moral and faith development
as suggested by the cognitive structuralist tradition. Suspecting
that cognitive structuralist based assessments, and thus, their
theories, render fNRM adherents' faith and moral development in
overly simplistic terms, this study proposes a qualitative method
to analyze the sociological, historical, theological, and
anthropological factors involved in the religious worlds created
within fNRMs. This method, alongside traditional developmental
assessments, elevates, for full view, the complexities of faith and
moral development in fundamentalist communities. The studies of
these five fNRMs moved in different directions, but systematically
revealed different but complex factors, sophisticated styles and
modes of integration in patterns of reasoning involved in the daily
negotiations of living in faith communities, thinking through the
contents of faith, and maintaining faith-based commitments. The
results of this study point toward poststructuralism, with its
theories of multiple subjectivities, to account for the complex
patterns of reasoning required to negotiate multiple subjectivities
in a complicated world. Perhaps poststructuralist theories of moral
and faith development are needed to more accurately describe both
of these processes in the context of postmodernity.
Poststructuralism suggests that, rather than stages of development,
individuals adopt constellations of patterns of reasoning that are
locally and communally driven.","Introduction..........................................................................................................

Hippocampus",,
published,emory:ghtnm,"Mehta, Cyra Christina",Centralization in Small Graphs,"Network science provides a new and valuable set of techniques
for investigating problems by providing a different perspective.
One important network characteristic is centralization, which is a
quantification of how much one node dominates the network according
to a particular measure of node influence. Centralization is a
graph-level measure and can be calculated for closeness,
betweenness, and degree. This research investigated the range of
centralization values obtained by common graph generating methods,
properties of centralization, and whether centralization is
associated with disease spread. The first study examined the
centralization values and graph structures produced by Erdos-Renyi
Gnm random graphs, Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment graphs,
small world graphs, and two node preferential attachment graphs as
well as Star Start, a new graph generating method that produces
graphs across the full theoretical range of centralization values.
Erdos-Renyi random graphs produce low to moderately centralized
graphs and small world graphs are only low to moderately
centralized. Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment graphs can be
highly centralized but do not produce a variety of graph
structures. Two node type preferential attachment and Star Start
produce most of the full range of centralization values with a
broad range of structures. Using the Star Start program, the second
study explored the properties of centralization, including
prediction based on average or maximum node centrality. Correlation
between centralization measures decreases as graph order increases.
Models predicting centralization based on maximum centrality
perform reasonably well, especially when the maximum centrality
value &lt;0.6. Models based on average centrality fit poorly after
the average increases past the average centrality of a star graph.
Lastly, the association between centralization and epidemiologic
endpoints using a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) compartment
model of disease spread was examined. As degree or betweenness
centralization increases the peak number of infected nodes
increases, time until the peak decreases, and the final cumulative
number of infected nodes also increases. Closeness centralization
does not have as strong of a relationship and should only be
considered for connected networks. The results also confirm that
infecting the most central node first produces a more severe
epidemic than randomly selecting a node.",

mortality among children
in the United States, but the risk of preterm birth is not fully
explained by individual
maternal risk factors. There is some evidence that living in a high
crime
neighborhood may contribute to an increased risk of preterm
birth.
Methods: We used multilevel logistic regression to
investigate the association between
both census tract and census block group violent crime rate on the
probability of
preterm birth, controlling for potential individual and
neighborhood-level
confounders. We restricted our analysis to births within the City
of Atlanta, GA in
the years 1998-2006.
Results: Preterm births comprised 13.1% of 50,665 births in
Atlanta. Violent crime rates
at the block group level showed statistically significant
interaction with maternal
age. The odds of preterm birth among women in the highest two
violent crime
quartiles were increased compared to women in the lowest violent
crime quartile
among women 30 years and older; there was no association between
living in the

published,emory:pg032,"Shrestha, Vinish",Understanding the Demand for Alcohol in the United States,"This dissertation consists of three chapters which are dedicated
in understanding the demand for alcohol in the United States.
Chapter 1 investigates whether heavy drinkers among young adults
are more responsive to higher alcohol prices compared to light or
moderate drinkers. I find that the price elasticity of demand is
highest among heavy drinkers. Chapter 2 studies the relationship
between cigarettes and alcohol by investigating the effect of
higher cigarette prices on alcohol consumption among young adults,
exploiting sizeable variation in cigarette prices after the Master
Settlement Agreement. I find that young adults increase their
alcohol consumption in response to higher cigarette prices
suggesting that cigarettes and alcohol are substitutes. The pattern
of substitution is prevalent across the light, moderate, and heavy
drinkers; however, substitution is more concentrated towards heavy
drinkers. Chapter 3 improves the understanding of the optimal level
of alcohol taxation in the United States by considering the
external cost associated with heavy drinking. I conclude that the
optimal tax rate is 14 percent of price per drink. Even the
conservative estimates suggest that heavy drinkers do not pay their
way out.","-- Contents -- Preface 1 -- Chapter 1: Estimating the Price

By Carla S. Heyler

Prosocial behaviors in humans are known to be motivated by empathy
and intrinsic gratification known as ""warm glow"". Historically
thought to be uniquely human, similar self-rewarding mechanisms
were recently proposed to motivate other-regarding behavior in
brown capuchin monkeys ( Cebus apella). To determine if
capuchins are indeed motivated to be prosocial by a sense of
satisfaction derived from helping another individual (i.e. ""warm
glow"") or instead by a desire to eat at the same time as another
individual, twelve capuchin monkeys underwent two types of tests.
The first (""Token Exchange"") paired subjects with a partner and
allowed them to choose to be prosocial (reward both monkeys) or
selfish (reward only the choosing monkey). In the second (""NE
Control""), the same monkeys were paired but the choice was
eliminated; the experimenter simply delivered food rewards
according to choices made during
the ""Token Exchange."" The occurrence of mutually affiliative
behaviors per subject during prosocial and selfish outcomes in both
tests was recorded and compared. The rate of affiliative behavior
was found to be higher during a prosocial than a selfish outcome in
both the Token Exchange and NE Control, suggesting that affiliative
behavior is facilitated by the presence of two food rewards and,
thus, the opportunity to eat together. Therefore, capuchin monkeys
may be motivated to be prosocial by a sense of satisfaction derived
from eating with another individual. Surprisingly, the overall rate
of affiliative behavior was also found to be higher during the NE
Control than during the Token Exchange, indicating that the
circumstances under which food is being delivered and consumed may
likewise affect affiliative behavior overall.","INTRODUCTION………………………………………………………………………...1

Speech and Silence in the Fiction of Charlotte Bronte, Jean Rhys,
and Margaret Atwood","Throughout Charlotte Bronte's
Villette, Jean Rhys's Good Morning,
Midnight, and Margaret Atwood's The Blind
Assassin, the narrators attempt to both express and to
escape their physical, psychological, and social
imprisonment. Bronte's Lucy Snowe and Rhys's Sasha
Jensen's internalized perceptions of gendered expectation initially
prevent them from breaking free from cycles of isolation and
repression. As they experience various nervous breakdowns, these
narrators attempt to reconcile their fragmented identities, turning
to external remedies such as alcoholic substance and religious
rhetoric. These attempts themselves ultimately fail to move Lucy
and Sasha towards a more cohesive, conceptualized presentation of
identity. However, by articulating these failed
attempts, writing themselves, and formulating their own stories,
Lucy and Sasha gain insight into the self-perpetuating processes of
isolation and repression, eventually acquiring conscious agency
over their construction of identity both on the page and in the
events which subsequently unfold in their narratives.
However, although Lucy and Sasha attain agency through
inhabiting the ""I,"" their narratives remain entangled in the
internalized strictures inherent in the masculine discourse
revealed, performed, and replicated by their constructed
subjectivities. Through the interaction of
self-reading eye with the self-written ""I,"" Atwood's Iris
reformulates the boundaries of reclaimed agency to encompass the
multiplicity of the self and the self of multiplicity, ultimately
locating subjectivity beyond previous conceptions of the first
person. Through simultaneously examining the alternative
temporalities and differing narrative perspectives produced by
Victorian, Modern, and Contemporary constructions, I hope to
parallel Lucy, Sasha, and Iris's narrative journeys by
deconstructing the critical categorizations which often limit the
interpretative possibilities of the literary works.","Introduction....................................................................................................................................1

Neuronal activity as a therapy for peripheral nerve injury.
Author: Laura Jones
Moderate daily exercise is an effective way to enhance axon
regeneration and improve functional recovery from peripheral nerve
injury. Increased neuronal activity associated with locomotion has
been hypothesized to be the basis for this facilitation, but other
factors also have been suggested. Neuronal activity can be produced
separately from these other potential sources of enhancement of
axon regeneration using optogenetics. We hypothesized that
increased neural activity would be sufficient to promote axon
regeneration after peripheral nerve transection. In mice that
express a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2),
and yellow fluorescent proteins (YFP) in neurons, we activated
axons in the sciatic nerve using blue light immediately prior to
transection and measured axon regeneration at three time points:
two, three and four weeks post transection. By two weeks after
injury, optical activation enhanced axon regeneration to the same
extent as electrical stimulation. Treatments with brief electrical
stimulation or optical activation just prior to nerve transection
and repair both resulted in larger M responses three weeks later,
but the optical treatment led to nearly exclusive enhancement of
regeneration of axons which were ChR2+. By four weeks after sciatic
nerve transection and repair, significant reinnervation of muscle
fibers had occurred in all animals studied. In mice treated
optically, all of the re-occupied motor end plates were ChR2+,
consistent with selective enhancement of optically activatable
motor axons. These anatomical observations are consistent with our
hypothesis that increased neuronal activity is adequate to promote
axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury.","Table of Contents --

This dissertation is about beginnings and pre-beginnings. It is
about what happens to
small human bodies that are birthed before their organs have
acquired the very basic
capacities for life, before they are capable of corporeally
existing in a world separated
from the bodies of their mothers. It is about jumpstarting the
premature lives of small
human bodies that were perhaps never intended for life and
sustaining these lives within
neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)- buying time, dodging the
limits of human
biology, and waiting for physiological capacities for life to
emerge. It is equally about
how the many individuals who care for, are related to, and come to
love them, cope with
the heartbreak of knowing that technological interventions for
sustaining premature lives
necessarily include pain and the possibilities of a diminished
quality of life. Most
critically, it is about how individuals find their way in the midst
of these uncertainties,
indeterminacies, and hardships to transform a small premature human
body, alive or
dead, into a home for a soul; and in the process, transform and
re-examine their own
ideas of who they should be (or not be) and who they are (or are
not).","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- PROLOGUE 1 -- CHAPTER 1: IT'S TOO SOON -- 40

Geospatial and Demographic Characteristics of
Sudden Cardiac Death in Fulton County, GA, 2006-2008
Objective: Sudden cardiac death is a leading cause of death
and often the first sign of coronary
heart disease. It is critical to identify characteristics of this
disease in order to design effective
interventions. The aim of this study was to examine whether
socioeconomic status is associated
with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.
Methods: Death certificate data was used to identify all
out-of-hospital cardiac deaths that
occurred in Fulton County, GA between 2006-2008. Geospatial
characteristics were evaluated in
ArcGIS. A Poisson regression analysis was conducted to examine the
relationship between
poverty and the risk of cardiac death, while controlling for age,
race and gender.
Results: Poverty increases the risk of sudden cardiac death,
however as median age increases, the
effect of poverty decreases. The average median age by census tract
was 34.2 years and at this
age, poverty increased the risk of death by 13% (RR 1.13; CI 1.05,
1.21). When the median age
increases by 1 standard deviation to 40.3 years, poverty increases
the risk of death by 8% (RR
1.08; CI .99, 1.19).
Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of
identifying areas with a high density of
cardiac arrest and using this information to better understand the
population characteristics of the
disease as well as target interventions.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction

Harvest: A Mixed Models Analysis","Foodborne illness associated with produce is costly in terms of
human health and economic losses. The need to improve food safety
is increasing as demands on the global food supply are also
increasing. However, the environmental conditions that influence
the inoculation, proliferation, and diffusion of fecal
contamination on produce are not well understood. Therefore, we
aimed to assess an association between temperature or precipitation
and fecal contamination on produce prior to harvest. Between 2000
and 2002, we assayed for three fecal indicators (APC, coliforms, or
Enterococcus) on 10 different types of produce collected
from 15 fields that were clustered in the southern U.S. Weather
data was obtained from a single NOAA weather station within 100km
of the fields. We used a mixed models approach to analyze the
relationship between indicator concentrations on crops and weather
over a week-long lag period prior to sample collection. Average
daily temperature was significantly associated with indicator
growth for five days prior to sample collection. On the other hand,
daily total precipitation had a significant association with
indicator concentrations for only one or two days prior to
collection. Our results indicated that there is a significant
association between weather and fecal indicator proliferation on
crops in the field. Indicator concentrations may have increased as
the temperature increased towards the optimal growing temperature
for the bacteria. Precipitation may be creating moist conditions
conducive to bacterial growth, spreading contamination onto the
field, or washing contamination off of the plant. Therefore, new
food safety policies that are weather dependent may be necessary to
improve the safety of the global food supply.","-- LITERATURE REVIEW - 1 -- Why Study Produce Contamination? - 1 --

together the modern Jewish community, and the nature of Jewish
music itself. I
interviewed seven leaders of the Atlanta Jewish community from
different denominations
in order to gain knowledge about Jewish music from a wide range of
sources all within
one broad community. I then analyzed the data from these interviews
and found common
themes that arose from each interview and explored each topic in a
different chapter of
my thesis. While every leader had distinct ideas about the nature
of music and what
Jewish music is, these issues were all ones that the different
denominations struggle with
within their own congregations. I began by thinking of music as a
symbol in terms of
how Geertz defines one - as an idealistic notion that represents
religion. In the end,
however, the wide diversity and range of music within the community
demonstrates how
while music is a symbol of Judaism, Geertz's absolute, universal
term of symbol is one
that is too restricting and all encompassing.","Table of Contents --

published,emory:dw3m0,"Rios, Vanessa","Resilience and Adolescent Health: An assessment of risks and
assets in the Bañado Sur neighborhood of Asunción,
Paraguay","Background: Resilience describes the
attainment of positive outcomes despite adversity and
the process by which these outcomes are achieved. In a global
health context where youth development often occurs in environments
with accumulated risk factors, resilience-based interventions could
serve to improve outcomes across multiple dimensions of health and
wellbeing. However, while the utility of these interventions is
limited by their contextual appropriateness, resilience research in
developing countries and with marginalized populations remains
scarce.
Methods: This qualitative study was
conducted in the Bañado Sur neighborhood on the outskirts of
Asunción, Paraguay, characterized by poverty and
marginalization. In-depth interviews were conducted with 20
adolescents from this community who were identified as particularly
resilient. Data were analyzed to understand how adolescents were
able to effectively navigate their adverse environments and to
characteristics of these positive deviants that could be
applied to promote resilience across multiple outcomes among other
youth in the community.
Results: Factors at the community,
organizational, interpersonal, and individual level influenced
adolescents' resilience by motivating them to persevere despite
adversity, shaping their decision making, and helping them navigate
towards resources. Resilience emerges from interactions among
factors within these different social ecological strata. More so
than any one factor in isolation, several factors were identified
as pathways that connected youth to multiple assets and
resources. Sports, school, religion, and Mil Solidarios, the
community-based organization hosting the present study, were
discussed as pathways by the participants.
Discussion: While many of the general
findings of the present study were consistent with the
broader resilience literature, some factors appear to have
stronger implications for resilience among youth in the Bañado
Sur, highlighting the importance of understanding youth resilience
in a context-specific way. Particularly relevant to youth in the
Bañado Sur were the perception of education as the means for
social mobility, the importance of collective struggle, resilient
role models, and social distancing skills. Additionally, the
concept of resilience pathways has important implications:
connecting youth to one of the identified pathways could have
far-reaching effects on their resilience because of their effects
across multiple levels of individuals' ecologies and dimensions of
their lives.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1:

Applies To The Work Aspirations Of Emory University Undergraduate
Students","With societal changes in effect since the 1963 publication
of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique roughly fifty
years ago and the power of choice more apparent, it is increasingly
more imperative to look at the role of the individual to understand
men and women's differing experiences in the workforce.
Specifically, I seek to build off previous research by delving into
how gender influences the work aspirations of college seniors as
they transition into adulthood and prepare to enter the
workforce. First, I present a theoretical framework
highlighting the importance of gender norms and cultural schemas,
the persistence of the separate sphere ideology, and the normative
alternatives approach to understanding the decision-making process
of male and female students. Next, I look to the empirical work
completed on the matter of gender and work values to discuss any
patterns currently mentioned by researchers in the field. I
conducted thirty in-depth, semi-structured interviews with seniors
at Emory University regarding their decision-making processes and
the work values participants draw on when framing their decisions.
This paper presents major themes related to gender differences
among male and female college students' work aspirations. Despite
the expanded freedom of choice indicative of the contemporary labor
market, my analysis adds to previous research demonstrating
differential work values and continuing adherence to the separate
spheres ideology.","Introduction....................................................................................................................................

published,emory:pkbt6,"Guagliardo, Sarah Anne Jablonski","Patterns and Mechanisms of the Geographic Expansion of Aedes
aegypti in the Peruvian Amazon","Transmitted to humans through the bites of infected
Aedes mosquitoes, dengue is the world's most important
arbovirus, with nearly 2.5 billion people at risk for disease.
Although present in the Americas for centuries, the primary dengue
vector Aedes aegypti is expanding from urban to peri-urban
and rural areas throughout Latin America after its near continental
elimination in the 1950's. In the Peruvian Amazon, Ae.
aegypti is abundant in urban centers such as Iquitos (pop:
~400,000), and in recent years, has also been found in a number of
neighboring communities. Ae. aegypti active dispersal
(through flight) is limited to &lt;100m, and therefore
long-distance dispersal must be facilitated through human activity.
In this dissertation I: 1) assess risk factors for Ae.
aegypti invasion through entomological surveys in 34
communities; 2) clarify the relative importance of different
vehicles (i.e.- boats, trucks) in the invasion process; and link
vehicle infestation with transportation data to measure the
frequency and intensity of new introductions (""propagule
pressure""); 3) measure oviposition frequency on river boats; and 4)
characterize gene flowusing 10 microsatellite markers and linked
such data to long-distance dispersal mechanisms. Taken together,
evidence from this dissertation highlights the importance of river
boats as major drivers of Ae. aegypti regional expansion. My
main findings are: 1) risk for invasion is a function of
connectivity and proximity to major urban centers; 2) several
vehicle types are responsible for transporting immature and adult
mosquitoes (mostly barges); 3) few individual barges produce the
majority of mosquitoes, acting as ""super-transporters."" These
results have important implications for dengue control: many novel
control strategies (i.e.- genetically modified ""sterile""
mosquitoes) falsely assume that mosquito populations are immobile,
whereas my results show continual gene flow among Ae.
aegypti metapopulations. From an invasion ecology perspective,
I show that propagule pressure can be more precisely quantified
through field surveys. I also propose a new method for evaluating
genetic isolation by distance through the ""Propagule Pressure
Index,"" combining transportation data with vehicle infestation
rates. Broadly, results from this study can help anticipate vector
population mixing and future range expansions of dengue and other
viruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti.","Table of Contents -- Chapter

early identification of HIV in high-risk persons in Fulton County,
Georgia","Background: Acute HIV infection (AHI)
is characterized by rapid viral replication and lack of detectable
antibodies in the early stages of infection. Because standard
testing relies on antibody detection, failure to detect AHI when
individuals are highly contagious is a missed opportunity for
prevention. In 2012, the Fulton County Department of Health &amp;
Wellness (FCDHW) received funds to implement nucleic acid
amplification testing (NAAT) to detect AHI among persons from
high-morbidity zip codes in Metropolitan Atlanta. This report
evaluates the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the program after
12 months of implementation.
Methods: AHI was defined as a positive
NAAT test in a patient with a negative HIV antibody test between
August 2012 and January 2014. Process measures for testing,
laboratory, and outreach were reviewed. A cost analysis was
performed from the FCDHW program perspective to evaluate the
incremental costs of conducting NAAT after rapid antibody testing.
Using estimates from previous models, an AHI positivity rate
≥0.1% and program cost ≤$24,876 per new HIV infection
were set as thresholds for cost-effectiveness.
Results: Eighty-six new HIV infections
were detected by antibody testing alone. Among 4,686 NAAT tests
conducted, 3 cases of AHI were identified (AHI positivity rate
0.06% [95% CI: 0.01 - 0.19]). The median turnaround time for NAAT
results was 22 (15-35) days. No case successfully initiated
antiretroviral therapy. The rate of AHI in men who have sex with
men (MSM) was 0.69% [95% CI: 0.08-2.49], which was significantly
higher than the overall AHI positivity rate (p=0.015). The
estimated program cost per additional HIV infection identified by
NAAT was $70,600.
Conclusions: The use of NAAT among
individuals from high-morbidity zip codes improved HIV case
identification by 3.5%; however, strong evidence for
cost-effectiveness is lacking. Based on these data, future efforts
should consider targeting NAAT to those with behaviors at highest
risk for exposure to HIV (e.g., MSM), rather than targeting
specific geographic areas. In addition, decreasing turnaround time
for laboratory results and improving outreach to individuals with
AHI will be critical in order to realize the full potential
benefits of implementing NAAT in this setting.",

Science in the Lives of High-Achieving African-American High School
Seniors","As the U.S. economy becomes more global, and its demographic
make-up shifts; increased attention has been placed on the
underproduction of scientifically and technologically trained U.S.
citizens by government officials and business leaders. This
underproduction can be attributed to the continued
underrepresentation of minorities, particularly African Americans,
in the sciences. Although, researchers have identified a variety of
historical, cultural, and social explanations for the lack of
African Americansin science careers, increasing the number of
African Americans pursuing careers in science or science-related
fields remains a challenge for science educators and policy
makers.
This study explores the effect of science experiences on
students' career decisions and future goals. Specifically, it
considers how ""high-achieving"" African-American high school
students, who have participated in at least one science
intervention program, draw on their lived experiences to formulate
definitions of science and visions of success. The study was
conducted as a Narrative Inquiry that explored five
African-American students' perceptions of science in three ways: as
it influenced their formal schooling, as it shaped their everyday
interactions, and as it interacted with their future goals. Data
were collected over three years and included interviews,
application packets, and demographic survey. Individual narratives
of the five ""high-achieving"" African-American students' were
constructed. These narratives provide insightful and critical
assessments of their formal and informal experiences in science.
Key understandings about the students' perceptions of science
emerged.",

published,emory:16r7p,"Daniel, Carrie Rose",Diet and Inflammation in Colorectal Cancer Prevention,"There is no complete agreement as to which aspects of diet
prevent or promote colorectal cancer (CRC). Some of the most
salient mechanisms are related to growth and inflammation, but
biomarkers are needed to bridge the gap between observational and
experimental evidence.
We investigated the association between diet and CRC risk on two
levels: in normal-appearing colorectal mucosa, where early risk is
believed to be expressed, and in a U.S. cohort followed for CRC
between 1999 and 2005. In the Markers of Adenomatous Polyps (MAP)
II colonoscopy-based, case-control study (n=203), we investigated
TGF-α, TGF-β1, and COX-2 expression as biomarkers of risk
for incident sporadic colorectal adenoma. In the Cancer Prevention
Study (CPS) II Nutrition Cohort, we prospectively investigated
dietary intakes of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, separately and
in a ratio, with CRC incidence (778 cases in 96,152 men and
women).
In the MAP II study, we found that expression of TGF-α, and
the ratio of TGF-α to TGF-β1, was higher in cases than
controls (Pdiff&lt;0.05) and directly associated with adenoma (Odds
Ratios: 2.23 and 1.40, respectively). COX-2 and TGF-α
expression appeared to vary by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug
(NSAID)-use; otherwise COX-2 did not differ by case-control status.
All markers were associated with inflammatory risk factors for CRC.
In the CPS II study, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 intake was not
associated with CRC risk. In women, marine omega-3 intake was
associated with a 20-30% lower risk, particularly in rare
NSAID-users. Total omega-6 intake was inversely associated with CRC
risk in men [Relative Risk (RR): 0.79; Ptrend = 0.07], and
alpha-linolenic acid, the primary contributor to total omega-3
intake, was associated with increased risk in women (RR: 1.47;
Ptrend=0.10).
TGF-α showed the most promise as a biomarker of risk for
colorectal cancer, although other markers also appeared be
modulated by inflammatory risk factors. In the U.S. cohort, marine
omega-3 and omega-6 intake were associated with lower risk of CRC
in women and men, respectively. Future epidemiologic research
should continue to search for means to translate early pathways of
risk within the colon to larger studies of diet and CRC.","Chapter 1 Page 1 --

published,emory:ft2p2,"Rachwalski, Mark",Essays on Asset Pricing,"This dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay,
""Idiosyncratic Risk Innovations and the Idiosyncratic Risk-Return
Relation"" (with Quan Wen), examines the role of idiosyncratic risk
in asset pricing. I find that stocks with increases in
idiosyncratic risk tend to earn low subsequent returns for a few
months. However, high idiosyncratic risk stocks eventually earn
persistently high returns. These results are consistent with
positively priced idiosyncratic risk and temporary underreaction to
idiosyncratic risk innovations. Because risk levels and innovations
are correlated, the relation between historical idiosyncratic risk
and returns may reflect both risk premia and underreaction and
yield misleading inference regarding the price of risk. The results
reconcile previous work, which offers conflicting evidence on the
price of idiosyncratic risk, and help to discriminate among
explanations of the idiosyncratic risk-return relation. In the
second essay, ""Stock Wealth, Consumption, and Return
Predictability"", I construct a novel empirical model of expected
stock returns. The stock wealth-consumption ratio reflects expected
stock returns and consumption growth. Because consumption growth is
mostly unpredictable, much of the variation of this ratio likely
reflects changing expected stock returns. In contrast, isolating
expected stock return information from other variables may be
difficult (in addition to stock returns, the dividend yield may
predict dividend growth, while the consumption-wealth ratio may
predict non-stock wealth returns). Empirically, a detrended version
of this ratio strongly predicts U.S. and international stock
returns. In contrast to other predictive variables, predictability
does not deteriorate after 1980 and out-of-sample performance is
impressive. The third essay, ""Bonds, Aggregate Wealth, and Stock
Market Risk"", examines the role of bond risk in determining stock
prices. I find that bond returns predict consumption growth after
controlling for equity returns, which suggests that bonds capture
important information about aggregate wealth. Consistent with this,
bond risk is priced in the cross section of stocks. Bond risk
partially explains some well-known anomalies. The results suggest
stock indices are an insufficient proxy for aggregate wealth and
that bond risk is an important component of consumption risk.","Essay One: Idiosyncratic Risk Innovations and the Idiosyncratic

Costimulation Blockade","During the last fifty years, organ transplantation has become a
favored treatment option for patients with otherwise incurable
conditions. Nevertheless, the immune response to donor tissue
remains the major obstacle to long-term graft survival.
Prolongation of allograft survival through T cell costimulation
blockade (CoB) is based on the principle that T cell receptor
stimulation in the absence of costimulation leads to abortive
activation or deletion of T cells. However, resistance to
CoB-induced allograft survival is seen in some mouse models. CD8 T
cells are necessary for this resistance, but the mechanism by which
CD8 T cells mediate rejection in the absence of major costimulatory
signals is poorly understood. Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) promotes
CD8 T cell responses, but IFNγ-deficient mice show early graft
loss despite CoB. In contrast, we found that IFNγ
receptor-deficient mice show dramatically prolonged graft survival
under CoB. Investigating this paradox, we addressed the effects of
IFNγ on T cell alloresponses in vivo independent of the
effects of IFNγ on graft survival. We found that neither
IFNγ receptor-deficient recipients nor IFNγ-deficient
recipients mount anti-graft CD8 T cell responses. To explain graft
loss despite undetectable T cell responses in IFNγ-deficient
recipients, we found that direct action of IFNγ on the graft
was necessary for graft survival, as either IFNγ
neutralization in IFNγ receptor-deficient recipients or the
lack of the IFNγ receptor on the graft precipitated early
graft loss. Furthermore, IFNγ decreased cellular infiltrates
and hemorrhage and increased transcripts for tolerance-associated
molecules within grafts at early time points. In contrast to other
models, NK cells were dispensable but CD4+ cells were necessary for
graft maintenance. At late time points, IFNγ held in check a
dormant immune response, as IFNγ neutralization not only
precipitated graft loss but also led to increased transcripts for
cell-mediated response genes within graft-draining lymph nodes.
Importantly, late-term control via IFNγ was by direct action
on graft-derived cells and by indirect action on the recipient
immune system. Thus, IFNγ is required both for the recipient
to mount a donor-specific CD8 T cell response under CoB as well as
for allografts to initiate and maintain survival after
transplantation.","2 Introduction -- 17 Chapter One / Costimulation Blockade:

and his theory of causation, i.e., his hypothesis of the

By Junjian Huang
Cardenolides are secondary metabolites synthesized by
milkweed plants. The functions of secondary metabolites are not
fully understood but there have been studies that suggest milkweed
plants use cardenolides as a form of protection from generalist
herbivores. Monarch larvae are specialist herbivores that feed only
on milkweeds and the larvae are able to sequester these toxic
compounds into their bodies, which protects them from predation. In
addition to anti-predator properties, it has been hypothesized that
these cardenolides may possess antiparasitic properties as well.
The focus of these three experiments is to study the role of
cardenolides in the host-parasite system of monarch butterflies,
Danaus plexippus, and its parasite, Oprhyocystis
elektroscirrha. We found that latex from A. curassavica,
which contains a wide range and high concentration of cardenolides,
reduced the parasite load of infected monarchs; however, the
cardenolides digitoxin and ouabain did not show significant effects
of reducing parasite load in infected monarchs. This result
suggests that cardenolides may be involved since they are the only
organically active compounds discovered thus far in milkweeds.
However, further tests are necessary before we can draw any
definite conclusions regarding the anti-parasitic properties of
cardenolides.","1. Introduction

Redeeming the Past:
The 2001 Commemoration of the Paris Massacre of 17 October
1961
By Rachel White

On the night of 17 October 1961, 30,000 Algerians, including
families dressed in
their Sunday best, poured into central Paris from the suburbs to
protest the discriminatory
curfew imposed upon them several days before. Alarmed by the large
numbers of
protesters and incited to brutality by Paris police prefect Maurice
Papon, the Paris police
opened fire on the demonstrators. It is still unknown today how
many people lost their
lives that evening and in the following days, but historians'
current estimations range
from 32 to 200 deaths. The massacre was an act of police vengeance
and retribution for
the FLN assassinations of 29 police officers in the preceding
months. Most importantly,
the French state directly contributed to the cover-up following 17
October 1961. In the
first chapter, I present the massacre in the context of the
Algerian War (1954-1962) and
the turbulent history of colonization and de-colonization in
Algeria. The second chapter
addresses the media reaction in the months immediately following
the massacre and the
reasons for the supposed ""occultation"" of the massacre from French
memory. In the third
chapter, I examine the process by which this event returned to the
public scene during the
1980s and 1990s.
In the final chapter, I demonstrate the extent to which the 2001
commemoration
for the 40th anniversary of the massacre of 17 October 1961
reflects non-Algerian French
society's attempt to rewrite or revise its own history. The
commemoration represented a
step towards an official recognition of the massacre but stopped
short of acknowledging
state responsibility or of offering an official apology; president
Jacques Chirac made no
official statement for the commemoration. Through a study of the
press from the period
immediately following 17 October 1961 and the week surrounding the
2001
commemoration, concentrating on the newspapers La Croix,
Libération, and L'Humanité,
I explain how the respective newspapers attempted to justify their
actions in 1961 and
redeem their shortcomings through their coverage of the
commemoration. Finally, I
frame the discussion of the commemoration in the context of
questions of memory and
the limitations of commemorative projects.","Table of Contents -- Introduction -- Page 1 -- Chapter 1 -- A

Vincent J. Maffei
Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF) has been implicated in a
variety of signaling networks
especially in the immune system. As such, TNF dysregulation has
been linked to numerous
autoimmune diseases particularly ones of chronic inflammation. TNF
has been characterized
historically as an inducer of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkB) as well
as an inducer of apoptosis.
However, TNF in chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis
promotes hyper-proliferation
of keratinocytes. The epidermal growth factor receptor family
(EGFR) is a group of cell-surface
proteins also involved in keratinocyte proliferation. This work
reports that TNF induces EGFR
activation in HaCaT keratinocytes through a matrix-metalloprotease
(MMP) mechanism, which,
in turn, leads to mitogen activated protein kinase activity (MAPK).
MMP cleavage of EGFR-
ligands is the proposed method of TNF-mediated EGFR activity.
Moreover, TNF induction of
the EGFR and NFkB pathways are independent and separate, which is
contrary to current
perspectives on TNF signaling. While TNF-induced EGFR activation is
insufficient for cell
cycle entry, it does protect keratinocytes from TNF-mediated
apoptosis. Additionally,
interleukin-8 expression, a marker of inflammation, by TNF occurs
through mutually activated
EGFR and NFκB pathways. Finally, neutralizing antibodies for
the EGFR family were used to
dissect individual contributions of receptor pairs towards a common
signal output. The
observations found for TNF-induced, EGFR-mediated IL-8 expression
were plausible given
findings in other studies. This work reveals TNF's direct effects
on keratinocytes that may
contribute to inflammation pathophysiology.","Table of Contents --

In The Intracellular Transport of Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus
By Jasmine Clark
Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus, the prototypic D-type retrovirus,
co-translationally assembles immature capsids in the pericentriolar
region of the cell. From here, immature capsids are transported to
the plasma membrane for budding, release, and maturation into an
infectious virions. Several mutational and biochemical studies have
been employed to elucidate viral and host proteins important for
this intracellular transport. Although these studies provided very
important insight as to what proteins are involved in this portion
of the viral life cycle, they have relied on population analysis of
capsids. In this dissertation, we create a codon-optimized M-PMV
Gag-eGFP fusion vector with an optimized Kozak consensus sequence
and an alanine substitution at an internal methionine. This vector,
co-expressed with untagged Gag, produces fluorescently-labeled
capsids that are able to be visualized by real-time, live cell
imaging. Characterization of the trafficking of these fluorescent
capsids implicated a role for microtubules. This role was confirmed
by employing the use of cytoskeletal inhibitors. Furthermore, using
a mCherry-tagged M-PMV Env, co-transport of M-PMV Gag and Env was
observed, and this co-transport as well as incorporation of Env
into released virions required the presence of intact microtubules.
This data provides strong support for the hypothesis that in order
to produce infectious virus, M-PMV Env that has been transported to
the plasma membrane from the trans Golgi network is endocytosed and
recycled through the pericentriolar region, whereby these
Env-containing recycling vesicles interact with assembled immature
capsids, followed by co-transport, along microtubules, toward the
plasma membrane for budding.","Table of Contents -- Abstract -- Dedication -- Acknowledgements --

Voting Decisions in the U.S. House of Representatives:
The Case of Health Care Reform
By Elizabeth J. Giltinan
Health care reform has proven to be a controversial topic in
America for the better part of the
last century. This study seeks to understand how members of the
U.S. House of Representatives
make voting decisions when faced with a vote on health care reform
legislation by examining: (1)
constituency, (2) party leadership, (3) lobby/interest groups, and
(4) legislator's personal policy
preferences. The study builds on the work done by John Kingdon on
legislators' decision making
processes, and proposes that constituency and party leadership's
preferences will have the greatest
influence on a member's voting decision on health care reform. This
study answers this question with
a mixed method approach composed of logistic regression analysis
and in-person interviewing of
Representatives and their staff. The findings of the study support
the hypothesis that constituency
preference has the greatest influence on a member's voting
decision, though the influence of party
leadership on a member's vote is found to be questionable and in
need of further research. While also
requiring further research, members' personal preferences were
found to be very important to
members interviewed in making their voting decisions. Surprisingly,
interest groups were found not
to have a significant impact on members' voting decisions; instead
their influence was found to occur
earlier in the legislative process, during the legislation drafting
process. This study suggests that in
order to attain successful passage of high-salience health care
reform legislation, large constituency
majorities in members' districts provide the clearest signal to
members as to how to cast their votes.","Table of Contents --

II. Electrostatic Binding among Equilibrating 2-D and 3-D
Self-Assemblies","I. Self-Assembly of Thioether-Modified Cationic
Surfactants
Cationic surfactants with one or two sulfur atoms inserted at
various locations along their alkyl chains, were synthesized. Their
colloidal properties were thoroughly explored by surface tension,
fluorescence, and NMR. Furthermore, the thio-surfactants were
adsorbed into sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles. An oxidant,
periodate, was added to the system, and the subsequent rate of
thioether oxidation to sulfoxide, determined by in-situ NMR, was
found to be diminished (more or less equally for all sulfur loci)
by two orders of magnitude. In contrast, rates of hydrogen peroxide
oxidation were hardly perturbed by micellization. Once again,
however, there was no rate dependence on sulfur location within the
chains. These results are interpreted in terms of a disordered
micelle in which all chain positions have roughly equivalent access
to the micelle surface. The kinetic method for assessing exposure
to the external medium is applicable to self-assemblies and polymer
systems wherever the NMR resolution so permits.

II. Electrostatic Binding among Equilibrating 2-D and 3-D
Self-Assemblies
Six organic additives bearing a different number of anionic
charges, were added to a large excess of cationic surfactant
(dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, DTAB). The surface-tension vs.
log [DTAB] plot for solutions containing DTAB/trianion = 15:1
showed an abrupt break (routinely taken as the critical micelle
concentration, CMC) at 2.9 mM. This constitutes a 5-fold decrease
compared with a CMC of 15 mM for pure aqueous DTAB. There is a
10-fold decrease in the break-point concentration caused by a mere
3.3 mol-% of hexanion. Corresponding CMC values from DTAB/trianion
mixtures, measured by both conductivity and diffusion-NMR, gave
normal values of 14 mM. The unusual discrepancy between the CMC
based on surface tension and on the two ""bulk"" methods was
attributed to saturation of the air/water interface by a
DTAB/trianion complex far below the concentration at which the
micelles form. Thus, the sharp break seen in surface-tension ""CMC
plots"" need not in fact attest to actual micelle formation as is
almost universally assumed in colloid chemistry.","Table of Contents -- I. Self-Assembly of Thioether-Modified

Young Adult Women","Aim: The purpose of this study is to
explore the effect of social influences on body image disturbance
in young adult women. Specifically, we examined the perception
accuracy of overweight and obese young adult women considered by
friend group BMI.
Methods: Participants were recruited
from the greater Atlanta area using paper flyers placed in 8
colleges and universities, and e-flyers through a university email
list, as part of a larger study of the development of diabetes
prevention in young adults. For the current study, data from 43
young adult women aged 18-29 were used. Anthropometric assessment
by a trained nurse was performed to obtain BMI. The Body Image
Assessment Tool- Body Dimension (BIAS-BD) assessed perceived and
ideal body sizes for individuals and peers. Descriptive statistics
and a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on
perception accuracy and friend group BMI.
Results: Participants that were
categorized as overweight had a significantly higher mean
misperception (-6.009) than obese 1 and obese 2 and 3 participants
(-2.784, .6744), F (2,40)= 11.291, p=.000. There is no
statistically significant difference between mean ideal BMI between
the young women with normal and overweight/obese friend groups
(t=-.654, p=.528). Friend group BMI also did not play a
statistically significant role in perceived BMI or perception
accuracy (t=-.238, p=.813; t=.168, p=.867).
Conclusion: This study was
the first to attempt to understand the effect social influence has
on weight misperception in young adult women. This study offered
the first look into how peer BMI affected young adult women's
weight misperception. Clinicians should be aware of the differences
in perception accuracy of overweight and obese women. They should
create an atmosphere of weight loss that can support overweight
women to accurately perceive their body image. For obese women,
interventions should target increasing body dissatisfaction and
self esteem not perception accuracy.","Introduction 1 -- Background 2 -- The Obesity Epidemic in American

The Role of Literacy in
Diasporic African Spiritual Traditions in the United

By Tiffany D.
Pogue

Despite literacy scholars' clarion call for moving beyond
limited, and limiting, understandings of the literacy construct,
contemporary educational research still tends toward studies based
on mainstream literacy practices and traditional school settings.
Meanwhile, those Black cultural and literacy traditions that (1)
lie beyond the typical in-school setting and (2) furthest away from
White dominant cultural practices are so severely marginalized in
literacy research that educators presently have difficulty locating
them in the literature. As a result, one also finds it extremely
difficult to locate literature related to the role of literacy in
the practices of Diasporic African Spiritual Traditions (DASTs) in
the United States. To respond to this gap in educational
literature, this dissertation employs the ethnography of
communication and New Literacy Studies as twinned theoretical
frameworks to answer the following research questions:
1) In what ways has literacy been used in the
practice of DASTs in the United States?
2) How do practitioners of DASTs in the US define
and understand literacy within the context of these traditions?
3) In what ways might DAST communities constitute
African Diaspora Participatory Literacy Communities (ADPLCs)
(Fisher, 2003)?
Semi-structured qualitative interviews, general historical
methods including archival work, and instrument-based participant
observation have been employed to engage these questions and reveal
that DAST communities both record and decode information through a
variety of forms including color, rhythm, liturgical structure,
syllabic text, and material culture in order to transmit ideas
about cultural themes and ontology. The strategies for such
literacy are by design ambiguous in nature and interpreted only
through an informed consideration of context.","-- Table of Contents -- Chapter One: Remembering, Reordering, and

Reactivity with First-Row Transition Metals","The goal of this project is to generate ligands that can
induce two-electron reactivity in first-row transition metals for
catalysis. The primary focus of this research is to develop ligands
capable of facilitating two-electron reactivity with first-row
transition metals. These ligands, termed ""electronically responsive
ligands"" (ERLs), are designed to undergo ring chain tautomerism
(RCT) to stabilize FeII/IV cycles and
disfavor FeII/III cycles. The core
functionality in the approach to RCT in these ligands is to utilize
an imino-pyridine and a pendant anionic nitrogen donor,
specifically a sulfonimidate. The imino-pyridine will allow for
stabilization of an FeII center;
interconversion to the amido-pyridine, through intramolecular
nucleophilic attack by the sulfonimidate, affects the stabilization
of FeIV. Initially, the synthesis towards
ERLs proved difficult due to the presence of multiple reactive
sites in sulfonimides. Key intermediates obtained in the synthesis
of the target ERLs exhibited the desired RCT in the absence of a
coordinating metal. Unfortunately, the synthesis of these key
intermediates was low-yielding. Furthermore, it was observed that
sterics can bias RCT selectivity, with increased steric bulk
disfavoring the ring form over the chain form. Taken together,
these observations of ring chain tautomerism from our key
intermediates support the idea that our ERL design could
potentially be able to induce an FeII/IV
cycle, particularly useful for catalysis with organic
substrates.","-- 1. Introduction --

Association of Dietary Polyamines with Incident, Sporadic
Colorectal Adenomas
By, Kehinde Oladunni Raji

PURPOSE: To investigate the association of dietary
polyamines with risk of incident,
sporadic colorectal adenoma.

METHODS: To investigate the association of dietary
polyamines and risk for incident,
sporadic colorectal adenoma, data from the Minnesota Cancer
Prevention Research Unit
case-control study were analyzed. The colonoscopy-/community-based
case-control study
conducted 1991-1994, enrolled 30-74 year old 564 incident,
sporadic, colorectal
adenomas participants, 684 polyp-free controls, and 535 community
controls. Diet was
assessed using a 153-food item semi-quantitative Willet food
frequency questionnaire
(FFQ). Polyamine exposure was quantified based on responses to the
food frequency
questionnaire and a previously published report on the polyamine
content of select food
items. Polyamine intakes were categorized according to the
quartiles based on the
distribution among the community controls and analyzed using
unconditional
multivariate logistic regression.

RESULTS: Polyamine intake was inversely associated with risk
for colorectal
adenomas. The odds ratios (OR) for the highest relative to the
lowest category of
polyamine intake were 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33 -
1.00; p trend 0.0001)
and 0.76 (CI 0.43 - 1.33; p trend 0.04) in the comparisons with the
colonoscopy and
community-based controls, respectively. The inverse associations
tended to be stronger
among those with a more positive oxidative balance, no family
history of colorectal
neoplasms, and women who did not take hormone replacement therapy,
and for smaller
and distal adenomas.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that higher polyamine
intakes may be
associated with lower risk for incident, sporadic colorectal
adenomas, perhaps especially
for smaller and distal adenomas.

Analysis of the EF24-modulated signaling pathways for the
development of
novel cancer combination therapies
By Shala L. Thomas

This dissertation seeks to uncover the cellular mechanisms of the
curcumin analog EF24 that are responsible for its anticancer
activity and differ from the parent compound. Additionally, this
study highlights signaling pathways induced by EF24 that ultimately
interferes with its therapeutic effect. We suggest that identifying
these major pathways and inhibiting survival signaling will enhance
the anticancer activity of EF24. We provide evidence that
inhibiting p38 with pyrinidyl imidazole compounds potentiates
EF24-mediated inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and induction
of apoptosis. Additional studies suggest that one way in which
EF24-induced p38 activation promotes survival is through the
specific transcriptional up-regulation of Hsp70, a heat shock
protein strongly up-regulated in response to stress. Moreover, we
show that EF24 treatment results in microtubule polymerization,
leading to the inhibition microtubule-dependent pathways like HIF.
p38 inhibition further enhanced microtubule polymerization,
suggesting this anti-tubulin activity is involved in the
synergistic nature of the EF24 and p38 inhibitor combination. The
collective findings presented herein provide insight into the
mechanisms by which EF24 promotes cancer cell death, the cellular
response to EF24, and potential strategies in the form of
combination therapies to exploit of these cellular
activities.","Table of Contents -- Page -- I. Introduction 1 -- a. Curcumin 3 --

published,emory:br8w8,"Vakili, Jessica","Identification of an Effective Diabetes Screening Strategy:
Analysis of the Screening for Impaired Glucose Tolerance Study","Background: Establishing an effective and systematic formal
screening test is ideal for managing the
public health burden resulting from diabetes. The oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) is the standard to
identify diabetes with maximum sensitivity and specificity.
However, this test is quite time intensive and
inconvenient for patients. We sought to determine if pairing
simpler tests together might be a reasonable
substitute for OGTT.

Methods: The final sample of the Screening for Impaired
Glucose Tolerance study involved 1,573
subjects without known diabetes. Tests collected on these subjects
included random plasma glucose
(RPG), hemoglobin A1c, glucose challenge test (GCT), fasting plasma
glucose (FPG), and an OGTT.
Four different disease statuses were defined to signify a positive
diagnosis for diabetes. For each
definition of diabetes, receiver operating characteristic curve
were produced for individual tests as well as
for combinations of two tests.

Results: Despite disease status, OGTT and FPG consistently
had the two highest areas under the curve
analyzing all subjects. Additionally, the majority of paired tests
were significantly higher than their
matching single tests proving combinations of simple tests improve
screening accuracy. FPG + GCT was
the combined test identified with the highest area under the curve
for standard diabetes and high-risk
prediabetes. Instead of using an OGTT, GCT could be performed
conveniently during an outpatient visit,
followed by an FPG in patients previously screened with GCT.

Discussion: Our data and results do suggest that strong
consideration should be given to screening. These
findings propose that opportunistic screening in a clinical setting
of individuals at high-risk would be
justified and thus will help delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
Further research of this screening methods'
cost effectiveness would be necessary as well as future research
into additional diabetes screening
methods.","-- Table of Contents --

A Typology of Sonority Sequences in Word-Final Consonant
Clusters
By Presley Pizzo
Syllable structure across languages appears to be governed by a
Sonority Sequencing
Principle that states that sonority must fall in syllable codas.
However, this principle
does not hold for all syllables in all languages. In this study, I
examine the
phonotactics of 178 languages in order to find the distribution of
word-final
biconsonantal clusters that violate this principle. I classify
these languages according
to the types of clusters they allow. I use this typology to
demonstrate that violations
of the Sonority Sequencing Principle do not occur randomly, but
rather, according to
an implicational relationship where the presence of violations in
codas implies the
presence of compliant codas. However, a language type emerges that
does not follow
from the Sonority Sequencing Principle. This type allows sonority
plateaus of
obstruents but disallows sonority plateaus of sonorants, even
though these coda type violate the principle equally. Reviewing the
proposals for constraint sets that model the effect of the Sonority
Sequencing Principle in Optimality Theory, I conclude that the
unequal treatment of these sonority plateaus is best accounted for
by a universally fixed ranking between constraints on the sonority
of single positions in the syllable.","CONTENTS -- 1.

Empire Between the Lines: Constructions of Empire in British and
French Trench
Newspapers of the Great War

The First World War spanned continents, mobilized vast resources
and populations, and initiated new modes of contact within and
among empires. For the British and the French the war brought
colonial troops and supplies to Europe, involved fighting for
colonies in Africa and Asia, and brought about changes in imperial
policies. This dissertation is fundamentally concerned with British
and French soldiers' discourses of empire during the war.
Specifically, this project examines trench newspapers for
representations of colonial troops, depictions of non-European
campaigns, and descriptions of the German enemy, to identify ways
in which British and French soldiers experienced and envisioned
empires through the war and the war through empire. Trench
newspapers were informal papers created by and for soldiers and
circulated at or near the front. The papers were transitory
products of a collective endeavor that forged a community for
readers and helped re-order the world in the disorder of war. This
dissertation argues that soldiers' discourses in trench newspapers
demonstrate that the war was an imperial event for British and
French soldiers and that empire cannot be disentangled from the
experience of the war. Descriptions of colonial troops, and their
reasons for fighting, revealed ways in which British and French
soldiers understood and imagined their own respective empires.
Depictions of German wartime activity show that empire was an
interpretive lens for many soldiers seeking to make sense of the
conflict. Coverage of the Ottoman campaigns made explicit that for
some soldiers the war challenged orientalist and colonialist
tropes, which had been thoroughly internalized. The focus on trench
newspapers illuminates the common soldier's experience of the war
and the nature of imperial cultures.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Chapter 1. The Great War in

By Melissa Goldberg
The Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS) is a
measure applied to relational narrative
data to assess information about an individual's self/other
representations and interpersonal
functioning. While an abundance of research has used the SCORS to
assess adult psychopathology and
treatment response, less work has focused on adolescents. This
study aims to evaluate the
developmental stability of social cognition and object relations
across early and late-stage adolescents in
a clinical sample, its relationship to personality pathology and
adaptive functioning, and whether this
construct and measure provide incremental validity over personality
disorder diagnosis and age in
predicting multiple domains of adaptive functioning. SCORS scales
exhibited developmental growth
across age groups, showed significantly more pathology in
adolescents with diagnosable personality
pathology, and predicted domains of adaptive functioning above and
beyond age and DSM-IV
personality disorder diagnosis. These findings suggest that social
cognition and object relations
constitute aspects of personality crucial to adaptive functioning
that are related to but not fully captured
by personality disorder diagnosis.","Table of Contents --

Religiosidades en Tránsito: el simulacro aljamiado en el siglo
XVI español
By María del Mar Rosa-Rodríguez
This dissertation examines Islam, Judaism, and Christianity as
portrayed in Aljamiado
Literature, Judeo-Spanish Literature, and a 1504 fatwa. These
uncanny and hybrid texts exist on
the borderline between the alphabet of one language and the sound
of another (e.g. Spanish
written with Arabic letters or Spanish written in Hebrew
characters). This dissertation focuses
exclusively on Aljamiado Literature and intends to map out the
religiosities in transit of sixteenth-
Century Spain through the hybridity of language in this literature.
The first chapter deals with the
linguistic diversity in Aljamiado writings, creating a theoretical
framework of the Aljamiado
simulacra. The second chapter discusses several Aljamiado legends
and treatises that illustrate
religious overlaps between Islam, Judaism and Christianity. The
third chapter addresses the
religious subjectivities of sixteenth-century Spain produced by the
acts of simulation and
dissimulation and the discussion of a 1504 fatwa from the Mufti of
Oran. The dissertation
includes several original transcriptions from Aljamiado to Spanish.
These texts reveal covert and
subversive gestures of religious and linguistic transit, contrary
to the hegemonic definition of
Imperial Spain. Based on six years of extensive archival research
in Madrid, this dissertation
incorporates these marginalized texts into the Spanish literary
history and explains the religious
passing that takes place when a subject lives between the
simulation of Catholicism, and the
dissimulation of Islam and Judaism. [In Spanish]","Religiosidades en Tránsito: el simulacro aljamiado en el siglo

published,emory:d78b3,"Gandolfo, Elizabeth O'Donnell","Vulnerability, Resilience, and Resistance: A Theology of Divine
Love","This dissertation is a constructive theological project
that lays out structures of the human condition that dispose
humanity to vulnerability, suffering, and redemption. In this sense
it participates in the methods of both fundamental and liberation
theologies. I argue that the human condition is essentially
vulnerable; that there is a dynamic, causal relationship between
vulnerability, anxiety, and violence; and that divine love offers
human beings existential and practical resources for redemption,
experienced as resilience and resistance.
The project is divided into two parts. The first half of the
dissertation is an analysis of human vulnerability and its
relationship with anxiety, egocentrism, privilege, and violence.
Here I posit that the fundamental dimensions of human life that
make created existence and happiness possible also threaten the
human telos by exposing us to pain and suffering. The
anxiety surrounding suffering often causes human beings to
collectively mismanage vulnerability in systems of privilege, which
exacerbates the problem of vulnerability and leads to greater
anxiety and violence. This analysis of the human condition lays the
foundation for the theological heart of the dissertation, in which
I argue that divine love responds to vulnerability by empowering
human beings with resources needed for resilience in the face of
harm and resistance to violence and oppression. This redemptive
power of divine love has a Trinitarian structure to it, offering 1)
the invulnerable power of preservative love, 2) the
power-in-vulnerability of solidarity with the human condition, and
3) empowerment for creative transformation in the Spirit of holy
longing for abundant life. The project concludes with an analysis
of three practices that have the potential to nurture the growth of
divine love in Christians, and human beings in general: dangerous
memory of suffering, contemplative kenosis, and solidarity.
Throughout the dissertation, my argument is informed by women's
diverse and multi-faceted experiences of maternity and natality. I
place maternal narratives and practices in mutually critical
conversation with Scripture, historical theology, feminist
theology, philosophy, and ethics. Drawing on these sources, my
constructive proposal suggests that vulnerability is both the site
of our deepest wounds and the condition for the possibility of
experiencing redemption.",
published,emory:927vm,"Knoop, Kathryn",DEVELOPMENT OF M CELLS AND SMALL LYMPHOID TISSUES IN THE INTESTINE,"Mucosal surfaces are constantly bombarded with commensal
bacteria and foreign
antigen. To prevent constant inflammation, tolerance is induced to
many of the foreign
antigens encountered in Peyer's patches (PP) and isolated lymphoid
follicles (ILF).
Microfold cells (M cells), found as part of the follicle-associated
epithelium (FAE)
overlaying the PPs and ILFs, are specialized epithelial cells that
constantly transcytosing
antigen. The factors driving M cell development were previously
unknown; the
commonly held model being factors from the B cells and developing
follicle foster the
growth of M cells, as most M cells develop over follicles. RANKL, a
member of the TNF
superfamily, has been shown to be critical in development of
lymphoid aggregates
including lymph nodes and isolated lymphoid follicles. Direct
interaction of RANKL+
stromal cells in the subepithelial dome and RANK+ epithelial cells
on the FAE appears to
be essential to M cell differentiation.
In the absence of RANKL, M cells are reduced 98% and have a
disrupted pattern
across the follicle; these changes contribute to a reduction in
germinal centers in PP and
fecal IgA. Recombinant RANKL can rescue M cell development in
RANKL-/- mice and
promote the development of villous M cells on all of the small
intestinal villi, drastically
increasing the ability of the small intestine to take up antigens.
The development of
villous M cells can also be induced by the enteric flora,
specifically the enteric flora
found in mice lacking IgA. These villous M cells were dependent on
systemic RANKL,
supporting a model in which the commensal microflora and RANKL
coordinately
regulate the extent of vM cell differentiation in the small
intestine.
Next, a model of acute B cell depletion was used to better
understand the role of
B cells in M cell development. After two weeks of continuous B cell
depletion, M cell
development on the PP dome is virtually unchanged. Furthermore, B
cell deficient mice
maintain a wild type M cell density on the PP domes, though the
absolute number of M
cells is decreased as the follicle and FAE shrinks. Finally, in the
absence of RANKL
development small lymphoid tissue aggregates in the small
intestine, cryptopatches and
ILFs, is disrupted. Cryptopatches are reduced four-fold, and ILFs
are completely absent.
This lack of ILF development is due to the lack of CXCL13 in these
aggregates and a
failure to attract B cells to the follicle. Interestingly a
dependence on RANKL for
cryptopatch and ILF development is not seen in the large intestine,
where CXCL13
expression is controlled by some other mechanism, perhaps the
increased density of
enteric flora.
In conclusion, the data presented here suggests a new model of M
cell
development in which the major signal is derived from RANKL and
secondary
contributions may come from the enteric flora. Additionally, RANKL
is critical in the
development of ILFs in the small intestine. These novel functions
of RANKL suggest this
single cytokine is imperative in two events in the development of
the mucosal immune
system. By controlling both antigen sampling within the PP and
ILFs, and the
development of ILFs, RANKL is an important factor in orchestrating
peripheral
tolerance. Alongside RANKL, the enteric flora exerts collaborative
and partially
redundant signals to induce and maintain M cells in the FAE and
ILFs.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- PAGE -- A -- BSTRACT -- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS --

Mechanisms of
outside-in JAM-A mediated signaling
By Eric A.
Severson
 
JAM-A is a
transmembrane component of tight junctions that regulates multiple
processes, yet studies on the mechanism of JAM-A function are
lacking. We hypothesized that the ability of JAM-A to dimerize was
necessary for the mechanism of JAM-A function. Overexpression of
dimerization-defective JAM-A mutants or treatment with a
dimerization inhibiting antibody in 293T cells reduced cell
migration across permeable filters. Analyses of cells expressing
the JAM-A dimerization-defective mutant proteins revealed
diminished β1 integrin protein. A functional link between
JAM-A and β1 integrin was confirmed by restoration of cell
migration to control levels after overexpression of β1
integrin in JAM-A dimerization-defective cells. To extend upon
these results, we reported that JAM-A is physically and
functionally associated with the PDZ domain containing signaling
molecules Afadin and PDZ-GEF2, but not ZO-1, in the intestinal
epithelial cell line SK-CO15. Both Afadin and PDZ-GEF2 were
observed to co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with JAM-A. Loss
of JAM-A, Afadin or PDZ-GEF2, but not ZO-1 or PDZ-GEF1, similarly
decreased cellular levels of activated Rap1, β1 integrin
protein and the rate of epithelial cell migration. The effects
observed were secondary to decreased levels of Rap1A since
knockdown of Rap1A resulted in decreased β1 integrin protein
and cell migration. These findings suggest that JAM-A dimerization
leads to the close apposition of Afadin and PDZ-GEF2. The proximity
of PDZ-GEF2 and Afadin results in activation of Rap1A. Active Rap1A
stabilizes β1 integrin protein levels, which controls the rate
of cell migration. These results illustrate a novel mechanism for
JAM-A signaling based on its structural motifs.","Introduction...........................................................................................1

Pre-adolescent Children","FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME AND RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS SEEN IN
GEORGIA PRE-ADOLESCENT CHILDREN
OBJECTIVES: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a collection of
physical, mental, behavioral,
and/or physiological symptoms that present in infants and young
children exposed to
alcohol during fetal development. In addition to the well-known
medical problems
associated with FAS, some observational studies and the results of
animal research
suggest that children with FAS may also be at greater risk of
respiratory ailments such as
lung infections and asthma. There is a need for diagnosticians and
patients to fully
understand the wide array of medical problems that may develop from
fetal alcohol
exposure, yet few studies have investigated whether children with
FAS are more likely to
develop respiratory symptoms than children without FAS.
METHODS: Medical chart data from 625 pre-adolescent patients
of the Fetal Alcohol
Clinic at the Marcus Autism Center were analyzed in a retrospective
cross-sectional study
comparing patients across three FAS diagnostic levels (full FAS,
partial FAS, no FAS
diagnosis). Logistic regression was used to fit a model to describe
the association
between FAS diagnoses and respiratory outcomes. Asthma-related
symptoms were
analyzed as a separate outcome.
RESULTS: The full logistic model included gender, insurance
provider, maturity at birth,
and race/ethnicity as covariates. In all comparisons, respiratory
and asthma-like
symptoms were less common among those children with an FAS
diagnosis compared to
those without an FAS diagnosis. No significant association between
the prevalence of
FAS diagnosis and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms (or
asthma-related symptoms)
could be detected ( P &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The low statistical power, misclassification,
and lack of a proper
control group hinder this study's ability to detect a significant
association; however those
without an FAS diagnosis may have other conditions that make them
more susceptible to
respiratory symptoms. Future studies should explore the use of a
large and appropriately
powered cohort or case-control study in order to further examine
this possible association
and to help uncover the extensive physiological effects that result
from prenatal exposure
to alcohol.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

Streamlined Ellipsometry Procedure
","A new streamlined ellipsometry procedure for
measuring the physical aging of confined polymer films is
discussed. Supported polystyrene films both bulk (2.5
μm) and thin (down to 30 nm) on native silicon were used
to test this ellipsometry procedure. Four different methods to
calculate the physical aging rate, ß, of these
confined polymer films are compared: one method involving Struik's
original definition of physical aging rate, one method involving
the height of the polymer film normalized at 10 minutes into the
run h0 , one method involving the
Lorentz-Lorenz equation, and a final method which uses the thermal
expansion coefficient of a glassy polymer film and the change in
the index of refraction over time. Using these four methods on the
supported polystyrene films, the calculated physical aging rate
produces curves of physical aging rate against aging temperature
characteristic of those in the literature. The second method out of
four is chosen, ß = -(1/h0)
(dh/dlog t), as the best way to
measure the physical aging rates of confined polymer films.
Furthermore, the experimental time is optimized to 360 minutes of
physical aging. The dependence of physical aging rate on film
thickness is also tested. Below 100 nm in film thickness, a
decrease in physical aging rate with decreasing film thickness is
observed. This behavior may be explained by a gradient
in the physical aging rate as a function of depth, as
has been previously reported in the research literature. Now that
it is known that the new ellipsometry procedure
correctly characterizes the physical aging of supported polystyrene
films, the physical aging behavior of different polymers in a
supported state can be tested, as well as the physical aging of
polystyrene in a free-standing state.","Contents -- 1 Introduction. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Transcription on Imprint Establishment and Epigenetic Inheritance
in Caenorhabditis elegans","The Role of Histone Variants, Histone Modifications, and
Germline Transcription on Imprint
Establishment and Epigenetic Inheritance in Caenorhabditis
elegans
By Jackelyn Kay Arico
Epigenetic information such as parental imprints can be transmitted
along with genetic
information through the germ line from parent to offspring. Recent
reports show that histone
modifications marking developmentally regulated loci can be
transmitted through sperm as a
component of this information transfer. How the information that is
transferred is established in
the parent and maintained in the offspring is poorly understood.
Our lab had previously described
a form of imprinted X inactivation in C. elegans where
dimethylation on histone 3 at lysine 4
(H3K4me2), a mark of active chromatin, is excluded from the
paternal X chromosome (Xp)
during spermatogenesis and persists through early cell divisions in
the embryo. We first
examined the role of histone variants and histone modifications in
imprint establishment.
Although the histone variants examined were not required for
imprint establishment, and the
histone modifications characterized were not unique to the Xp,
these studies reinforced the
observation that the Xp (unlike the maternal X or any autosome) is
largely transcriptionally
inactive in the paternal germ line. Based on this observation, we
hypothesized that transcriptional
activity in the parent germ line may influence epigenetic
information inherited by and maintained
in the embryo. We observed that chromatin modifications and histone
variant patterns assembled
in the germ line can be retained in mature gametes. Furthermore,
despite extensive chromatin
remodeling events at fertilization, the modification patterns
arriving with the gametes are retained
in the early embryo. Using transgenes, we observed that expression
in the parental germline
correlates with differential chromatin assembly that is replicated
and maintained in the early
embryo. Expression in the adult germ cells also correlates with
more robust expression in the
somatic lineages of the offspring. These results suggest that
chromatin environments established
in the parental germ lines may provide a potential mechanism for
the inheritance of parent of
origin epigenomic content that can be maintained and heritably
affect gene expression in the
offspring.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Chapter 1: -- Introduction 1 -- Chromatin and

Affordable Housing and Governance in Cities  

By Kelly Hill 
 
This study examines the growing role of local governments in addressing 

the social welfare needs of the urban poor.  The theory developed here builds on 

the extant literature on urban governance models, specifically civic capacity 

which argues that major public problems require cross-sectoral collaboration, 

which occurs when stakeholders from across public, private and non-profit 

sectors work together to
achieve mutually held goals. 
I further contend that 
collaborative
activity within these coalitions is facilitated by a key political 

entrepreneur who works to
coordinate resources, minimize conflict and mitigate 

collective action problems.  
 
To
test this argument, I examine affordable housing politics in four cities: 

Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland and Washington D.C. between 2002
and 2007, to see 
what accounts for local policy responsiveness to
affordable housing shortages.  
This research ultimately finds that while civic capacity provides some insight into��

how local communities advance social welfare agendas, it is limited in��its 

explanatory power.

Cancer-related Factors, BMI, and Social Support on the
Health-Related Quality of Life of Cancer Survivors: A Report from
the American Cancer Society's Study of Cancer Survivors-II
(SCS-II)","Guided by the Stress and Coping Theory, this quantitative
study assessed the main and interactive effects of BMI and social
support on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
of male and female cancer survivors but adapted the framework to
take the main and interactive effects of race, and other
sociodemographic factors, into account as well. A cross-sectional
survey, entitled the Study of Cancer Survivors II (SCS-II), was
administered by the American Cancer Society to identify HRQoL
issues among female breast, colorectal, prostate, bladder, skin
melanoma, and uterine cancer survivors at two, five, and ten years
post-diagnosis. In this study, data from 1,767 cancer survivors was
included in final bivariate and multiple linear regression models.
Two-step multiple linear regressions were conducted separately to
assess the physical and mental HRQoL of male and female cancer
survivors. Step-one of the model included sociodemographic factors,
cancer-related factors, BMI, and social support while step-two
added bivariate BMI, social support, and race interaction terms
into the model. Results provided mixed support for various
sociodemographic factors that were significantly correlated with
the physical and mental HRQoL of each gender, with breast cancer
the only cancer-related factor to be significant (physical HRQoL of
female survivors). BMI was found to have significant main effects
for physical HRQoL across gender while social support was found to
have significant main effects on both physical and mental HRQoL
across gender. Race moderated the relationship between social
support and physical HRQoL among female cancer survivors and
between BMI and mental HRQoL for both genders. No evidence was
found to support the buffering hypothesis of the Stress and Coping
Theory. The results of this study contribute a unique
gender- and racial-specific perspective to cancer survivorship
research and warrant continued study of racial differences for
alterable correlates of HRQoL. Future research may be
able to expand these findings to provide justification for
potentially important HRQoL interventions targeting
modifiable behavioral and psychosocial factors among particular
subgroups of cancer survivors.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1:

when there was a need for more burial space. Along with the
preexisting columbaria, catacombs served as mass burial
systems for both Christians and non-Christians in Rome. Although
catacombs were eventually out of burial use, they were still
integrated by church and became Christianized monuments. Therefore
catacomb art is generally considered as Christian art. The presence
of mythological figures such as Orpheus, Hercules, and Sol Invictus
can be observed in catacomb art before and after the Edict of Milan
in 313 A.D. The mythological figures likely represent Christ or
reflect the virtues of Christ, namely His divinity and humanity.
The presence of mythological figures in catacomb art indicates
visual syncretism of Christianity and traditional religions in
Rome. The relationship between the image of Christ and His identity
in Rome can be observed by studying the imageries in catacomb
art.","Introduction (pp. 1-2) -- Catacomb Paintings (pp. 2-6) -- 1.

ACROSS RANDOMIZATION ARMS AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN ZEHRP'S FAMILY
PLANNING EXIT INTERVIEW QUESTIONNAIRE","Background: HIV/AIDS is an issue affecting millions of
people worldwide. Not only does this pandemic threaten the lives of
those infected with the virus, but it leaves both families and
communities devastated as well. In Zambia, the prevalence rate of
HIV/AIDS is alarmingly high where, in urban areas, the rate is
nearly 20 percent. In a country where heterosexual sex accounts for
approximately 90 percent of new infections, Zambian women are left
particularly vulnerable. To address the challenges faced by HIV
serodiscordant and concordant couples in Zambia, the integration of
future planning services, family planning services, and HIV
programs has been suggested in previous research.
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop an
understanding of the beliefs and opinions reported by study
participants after having been enrolled into and completing
participation in the Zambia-Emory HIV Research Group's (ZEHRP)
Family Planning study.

Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis of data
compiled from an Exit Interview Questionnaire administered at the
conclusion of the Family Planning study. Study participants had
been randomized to different groups at enrollment in the study to
examine the impact of a video-based motivational intervention on
future planning behaviors among concordant HIV-positive and
discordant couples in Lusaka, Zambia. In this study, participant
responses were examined across intervention groups to determine
whether or not the intervention participants received was
associated with the responses they provided during participation in
the Exit Interview Questionnaire.
Results: Significant differences were found across
intervention groups among all study participants and across gender.
Those with exposure to the video-based motivational intervention
alone or in combination with a methods intervention were
significantly more likely to indicate variables related to future
planning as beneficial in comparison to those who had not received
exposure to the motivational intervention.
Discussion: Exposure to a video-based motivational
intervention modeling desirable outcomes coupled with access to an
advisor may positively influence ZEHRP clinic beneficiaries'
opinions of the information and services they receive. It may also
indicate an existing need for the inclusion of future planning
information and access to advisors in clinic services among this
population.","CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION 1 -- Introduction and Rationale 1 --

abortion: a qualitative examination of threats to women's autonomy
in Ocotal, Nicaragua","Ocotal, a relatively isolated city in the North Central region
of Nicaragua, is characterized by severe poverty and limited
sources of sexual and reproductive (SRH) care. National data
suggest unintended pregnancies are more frequent in Ocotal compared
to other major cities. Existing research does not adequately
explain why unintended pregnancies are more common in this
region.
Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs)
were utilized to explore women's experiences with unintended
pregnancy as well as the context surrounding such experiences. From
May to August 2014, three FGDs and ten IDIs were conducted in
Spanish with young women ages 16-27 years old from various
neighborhoods in the city. FGDs were completed with groups of women
to elucidate community norms regarding the topics of interest:
access to SRH services, knowledge of sexual and reproductive
rights, and opinions of the total ban on abortion. The FGDs
informed subsequent IDIs, in which individual women shared their
personal experience with an unintended pregnancy.
Women identified numerous barriers to accessing SRH services,
such as: criticism by others, violence against women (VAW),
machismo, and lack of open communication with parents and partners.
Though participants had limited formal knowledge of sexual and
reproductive rights, they were able to provide examples of such
rights. Women believed their sexual and reproductive rights
originate from national laws, such as Law 779, which is meant to
eradicate VAW. Due to religious ideologies, most participants
agreed with the country's total ban on abortion, except in the case
of rape. Women also had extremely varied experiences with
unintended pregnancy due to: familial support, employment status,
relationship with the biological father, and other factors.
The findings of this study provide context for the high
prevalence of unintended pregnancy in Ocotal and describe the
complex interactions between multiple factors that the study
population believes are related to unintended pregnancy, including
Law 779 and the total ban on abortion. The findings of this study
serve as the foundation for future interdisciplinary research and
offers suggestions for potential interventions at the neighborhood,
city, and national levels to advance women's autonomy and improve
SRH outcomes in Ocotal, Nicaragua.","Table of Contents -- Table of Tables and Figures -- Acronym List --

published,emory:f904m,"Parr, Brendan Thomas",Rhodium Alkenylcarbenes: Novel Reactivity and Precursors,"The stability imparted to a rhodium-bound carbene intermediate
by an electron donating substituent is obviated by the broad range
of efficient and enantioselective transformations these
intermediates undergo. Introduction of an olefinic p-donor group
has enabled the development of new reactions in which this
non-innocent moiety participates directly in the rhodium-catalyzed
reaction.
Alkenyl substituted diazoacetates are particularly efficient
substrates for tandem ylide formation/[2,3]-sigmatropic
rearrangement between allyl alcohols and rhodium carbenes. The
reaction has been studied with appropriately functionalized
secondary alcohols for the synthesis of products containing vicinal
stereogenic centers in exceptional stereoselectivity. In addition,
modification of reaction conditions has enabled the implementation
of primary alcohols, previously deemed incompatible, as competent
partners.
The tandem ylide formation/[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of
allyl alcohols and alkenyldiazoacetates generates functionalized
products capable of participating in a cascade of reactions. Due to
the efficiency and limited byproducts associated with the rhodium
carbene transformation, the domino sequence can be conducted as a
one-pot process for the direct synthesis of cyclopentanes or
cyclohexanes, depending upon the substitution of the starting
alcohol. The individual reactions and intermediates have been
studied in detail to understand various chirality transfer
processes involved, in an effort to diagnose the limitations.
The 4-substituted-1,2,3-triazole nucleus has been identified as
a viable precursor for a range of classical and novel carbene
transformations. A unified strategy for the synthesis of
triazole-based alkenylcarbene precursors for rhodium-catalyzed
transformation has been developed. These substrates have been
applied to classical, enantioselective transformations of
alkenyldiazoacetates, including a detailed study of the tandem
cyclopropanation/Cope rearrangement. These rhodium carbene
precursors exhibit improved stability and ease of handling compared
with their alkenyldiazoacetate counterparts.
Triazole-based carbene precursors have been found to exhibit an
array of orthogonal reactivity compared with their diazo
equivalents, due to an apparent propensity for the formation of
zwitterionic intermediates upon addition of electron rich
p-nucleophiles. Many of these reactions involve cyclization of the
zwitterion through the imine moiety, resulting in the synthesis of
nitrogenous heterocycles. In addition, formal C-H functionalization
of aromatic heterocycles and arenes via electrophilic aromatic
substitution reactions to generate diaryl enamines has been
developed.","Table of Contents -- List of Abbreviations i -- List of Schemes ix

published,emory:d95hm,"Storyk, Elisa Belle","Examining Performance, Maintenance, and Mental Health Benefits of
Mindfulness-based Practices: Applying the Transtheoretical Model
(TTM) of Behavior Change","Mindfulness meditation, especially Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction (MBSR), has become an increasingly researched means of
helping people cope with stress (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). At present,
however, it is unclear what influences one's likelihood of
maintaining a routine mindfulness practice, and its associated
benefits to overall mental health and well-being.
This study used the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to examine
long-term maintenance of mindfulness meditation. A sample of 132
adults with previous MBSR training completed a self-administered,
online survey. TTM's constructs of cognitive and behavioral
processes of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy were
examined for their influence on maintenance of a regular
mindfulness practice. The study also applied TTM to explore how
maintenance of mindfulness practice was related to overall mental
health and well-being. Differences in the TTM constructs between
maintainers versus non-maintainers were assessed via t-tests and
multiple logistic regression. The association between readiness to
maintain a mindfulness practice and mental health was assessed via
a chi-square test.
Consistent with theory, behavioral processes were more important
than experiential processes for maintaining mindfulness practice
(O'Conner, Carbonari, &amp; DiClemente, 1996; Prochaska, Redding,
&amp; Evers, 2008). In a fully controlled model, helping
relationships and stimulus control were the only two significant
behavioral processes that were positively associated with
maintenance. Self-liberation and counter-conditioning were not
associated with maintenance, and use of reinforcement management
was significantly negatively associated with maintenance. High
levels of self-efficacy were also found to increase the odds of
maintaining mindfulness practice. Regarding mental health,
maintainers were significantly more likely to have flourishing
mental health than non-maintainers, who had more frequent moderate
or languishing mental health.
This study demonstrated that constructs of the TTM are
associated with maintaining a mindfulness meditation practice and
that a significant and positive association exists between
maintaining mindfulness practice and mental health. Based on these
results, constructs of the TTM can aid in facilitating an ongoing
mindfulness practice, which can be a means to attaining positive
mental health. The results of this study can inspire new and unique
ideas for promoting, and increasing, long-term maintenance of
mindfulness-based mediation techniques. This can increase overall
mental health in our community, as a result.","Table of Contents -- Ch. I: Introduction 1 -- Research

Configuring the Context of Realistic Christian
Hope:
A Multidisciplinary Inquiry into Practices of Pastoral
Care
for Marginalized Persons
By Bo-Rah Chung
What makes hope possible for those deemed
""minorities"" on the margins of society? The influences of
marginalization fundamentally constitute a person's experience of
hope over time. This dissertation uses a phenomenological social
constructivist approach to examine the complexity and ambiguity of
human experience in context through multidisciplinary analyses of
contemporary pastoral theologies of hope, life course perspectives
on inequality, and a theological anthropological model by Edward
Farley. This inquiry into everyday experience of marginalization
and hope extends the ecclesial dimension of Christian practice of
care. This research envisions a constructive practical theology of
realistic hope for marginalized persons in terms of a
faithful commitment to living in tragic and social vulnerability
and the freedom of vitality. Hope can be forged by everyday actions
and narratives. Christian hope for marginalized persons emerges
from the ecclesial and redemptive practices of care: life-affirming
relationships, participations, and dialogues.","CONTENTS -- Chapter -- ONE WHAT KIND OF HOPE FOR WHOM? . . . 1 --

Pakistan in relation to
its efforts in fighting the ""War on Terrorism."" Although
substantial aid and attention has
been paid towards securing the nation's borders and protecting its
nuclear arsenal, another
threat towards Pakistan's stability has been largely ignored: the
internal tension between
the nation's various ethnic groups. Since its inception, Pakistan's
minority ethnic groups
have felt that they are oppressed and trapped in a system where
they receive inequitable
treatment from the federal government. More specifically, they
argue that the dominant
Punjab province has created a hegemony over the nation where it is
able to divert
resources from the other provinces. Punjabi hegemony, however, is
at times challenged
depending on the political party in power. I will, therefore, argue
that an ethnic group's
ability to effectively mobilize at the provincial and national
levels (through representation
in the Provincial and National Assemblies) effects the fiscal
allocation that it receives from
the federal government. Essentially, I will examine the validity of
the minority province's
grievances by conducting a case study of the Sindh province and
examining whether
fluctuations in representation lead to corresponding fluctuations
in fiscal allocation.","Table of Contents -- Section pg. -- Introduction 1-3 -- A History

published,emory:bncxh,"Peng, Hesen",High-dimensional Universal Dependence Discovery,"The emergence of high-throughput data in biological science and
computer networks has generated novel challenges for statistical
methods. Nonlinear relationships and multivariate interactions are
abundant. The sheer volume of high-throughput data has limited the
application for traditional case-by-case analysis methods, whose
model assumptions, like linearity, are often not supported in
high-throughput scenarios.
To meet these challenges, we developed Mira score, a novel
probabilistic association statistic that accounts for
high-dimensional universal dependence. Mira score is defined as a
function of observation graph, and thus circumvents the curse of
dimensionality in high-dimensional data. The superior statistical
property enjoyed by Mira score has led to our development of an
efficient network reverse-engineering procedure for multivariate
dependence. As an example, the procedure has been applied to celiac
disease and lung cancer pathway interaction analysis, and has
achieved interesting findings.
Further more, in the supervised-machine learning scenario, we
proposed SeMira procedure, an efficient variable selection
procedure that accounts for high-dimensional universal dependence.
The SeMira procedure is capable of identifying universal
probabilistic association between multivariate response variables
and high-dimensional predictors. The highly desirable statistical
property of the SeMira procedure is discussed and numerical study
is conducted using both simulated and real genetic pathway
data.","1 High-dimensional Universal Dependence Statistic 1 -- 1.1

PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common
neurodegenerative disorder and it disproportionally affects older
populations. There is biological plausibility for the hypothesis
that vitamin D may offer neuroprotective benefit for patients with
PD or could improve clinical PD symptoms. This study aims to
examine whether high dose vitamin D supplementation, over the
Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), has a significant effect on
motor symptoms in patients with PD. A randomized, active
placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group pilot clinical
trial was conducted to evaluate the association of oral Vitamin D
supplementation with PD-related motor symptoms. Thirty patients
with PD and low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D
≤ 30 ng/ml] were randomly assigned to either high dose
vitamin D supplement (50,000 IU weekly dose plus 600 IU/day) or to
low dose supplement (weekly placebo plus 600 IU/day). Three motor
outcomes of primary interest were assessed at baseline and after 3
and 6 months of treatment with vitamin D supplement. When mean
scores for these motor assessments were plotted over time, there
were no consistent patterns of improvement in the treatment group
as compared to the active placebo group for most outcomes. However,
the mean time to complete the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) during the
""off"" medication state decreased over time for the treatment group
(mean change = -1.4 seconds), but increased for the placebo group
(mean change = 2.7 seconds). Despite the diverging trends for this
motor test, results from repeated measures ANOVA analysis indicated
no statistically significant improvement for the treatment group
over placebo group for any of the motor outcomes over time. These
preliminary results suggest that vitamin D supplementation had
minimal impact on PD-related motor symptoms.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- BACKGROUND

developing health communication products with the US Latin American
immigrant population","Introduction: Chagas disease causes
significant morbidity and mortality across the world. There are
currently about 300,000 people living in the US with Chagas
disease. Most of these people were infected while living in an
endemic area: parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America.
To communicate the importance of Chagas disease diagnostic testing
in the US, culturally specific health communication initiatives
should be directed at the US Latin American immigrant
population.
The US Latin American immigrant population has specific needs in
health communication. These needs include health literacy factors,
communication channels, and cultural influences. Health
communicators should consider these factors when designing a
product to promote Chagas disease diagnostic testing.
Theoretical Framework: The Health Belief Model and
Diffusion of Innovations Theory guided the research process and
product development for this project.
Methods: 12 US Latin American immigrants total
participated in a series of 3 focus group discussions. These focus
group discussions evaluated external health communication products.
They also critiqued and guided the development of the Chagas
disease health communication product of this project. After product
completion, the primary researcher interviewed 2 new Latin American
immigrants about the final product to verify the conclusions of the
study. Study results informed the development of a protocol to
guide further health communication with Latin American immigrants
in the US.
Results: Latin American immigrants have specific needs
and preferences in health communication. These needs and
preferences fall into different factions of health literacy and
health communication. Examples include preference for bright
colors, family-centered images, and simplicity in text. They also
prefer specific distribution routes for print media, such as
certain magazines and newspapers.
Conclusion: It is necessary to consider factors of
health literacy and cultural preference in health communication to
effectively motivate behavior change in the Latin American
immigrant population.","-- Abstract --

HIV in Manila, Philippines: An Evaluation of the Yoga for Life
Program","Background: The Philippines is experiencing a rapid
increase in HIV incidence, demanding additional HIV services from a
government with limited resources. Civil society responses attempt
to fill this service gap, provide programs for most at risk groups,
and confront stigma and discrimination. Yoga for Life (YFL) is the
first community-based yoga program focused on people living with
HIV (PLHIV) and others affected by HIV in Manila, Philippines. YFL
promotes yoga, meditation, and breathing as effective complementary
therapies for PLHIV while supporting standard biomedical treatment.
The program encourages positive prevention, healthy behaviors,
stigma reduction, and HIV advocacy in a supportive community
comprised of PLHIV and people at risk for and affected by HIV.
Methods: I conducted an evaluation of Yoga for Life to
assess the effect of the program on participants' physical and
mental health, risk behaviors, and overall wellbeing. Data
collection methods included in-depth interviews, questionnaires,
participant observation, and key informant interviews. The study
population consisted of HIV positive and negative YFL members, YFL
instructors, and local HIV specialists.
Results: Analysis of narrative data revealed the
significance of sexuality in relation to identity formation,
self-acceptance, social systems, and relationship to family.
Participants linked sexual identity and behavior to HIV risk,
exposure, and infection. They identified needs of people affected
by HIV including education, linkage to care, stigma reduction, and
social support. Due to their involvement with YFL, participants
report feeling happier, healthier, more socially engaged, and
better equipped to confront life's challenges. HIV negative
participants report a heightened awareness of and sensitivity
toward issues related to HIV.
Conclusions: Findings from this study depict some of the
challenges and unmet needs of Filipino MSM and PLHIV, contributing
qualitative data to under-researched topics. The study highlights
the impact of holistic psychosocial interventions like YFL that
provide individual and community level support. The study also
offers evidence of the effectiveness and applicability of HIV
interventions that incorporate complementary therapies.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CHAPTER -- 1 INTRODUCTION

Climate change is disrupting ecosystems worldwide. This disruption
can pose a
significant threat to human health through direct exposures and
diminished ecosystem
services. In the US and Canada, the pine forest ecosystems are
being dramatically disrupted
by pine beetle infestation. Recent decreased frequency of extremely
cold days and
corresponding increase in yearly winter temperatures have led to an
epiphytotic devastating
millions of acres of pine forest. The associated ecosystem
disruption has the potential to
cause significant health impacts from a range of exposures,
including increased precipitation
runoff and water turbidity, forest fires, and loss of ecosystem
services. This paper reviews
these health impacts and possible prevention strategies. The pine
beetle infestation highlights
the need for public health to adopt an ecological, systems oriented
view to anticipate the full
range of potential health impacts from climate change and
facilitate effective planned
adaptation.

Rules in Un-Ruled Lands: The Origins of Property Rights in
Palestinian Refugee Camp
Sectors across Lebanon and Jordan
By Nadya Hajj Parks
Scholars in such disparate fields as philosophy, economics, and
political
science argue that a system of well-defined property rights is a
key factor in
economic development and subsequently political stability and
security. Despite
significant theoretical and empirical support for the positive
effects of property
rights on economic growth and stability, much less is known about
the origins of
property right institutions, especially among marginalized groups
like Palestinian
refugees. On the basis of 152 interviews I test the efficiency,
distributional, and
socio-historical explanations for institutional formation.
Components of the
efficiency and distributional approaches were evident in camp
sectors in Lebanon.
An amalgam of all three approaches was evident in camp sectors in
Jordan.
Evidence suggests that existing institutional explanations are,
alone, inadequate at
explaining institutional formation. I discovered that hegemonic
powers like Fateh
or the Jordanian state can craft secure property rights despite
strong distributional
motives, in the presence of latent political contestation, long
time horizons, and
resource scarcity. In addition, intervening variables like common
pool resources
influence the strategic decision of actors to exploit property
rights. Finally,
results hold positive policy implications for marginalized groups
like Palestinian
refugees. Namely, marginalized groups can craft strong property
rights even in
the absence of a state authority.","Table of Contents -- List of Tables -- Abbreviations -- Chapter 1:

Empirical evidence for adaptive biases in learning and cultural
transmission","Over the past 25 years, the application of evolutionary theory
to understanding how natural selection may have shaped human
psychological mechanisms for cultural learning has generated a wide
range of hypotheses that together begin to lay the micro-level
foundations of cultural evolution. Under this framework, cognitive
biases for the acquisition beliefs and practices that are acquired
socially (culture as defined here) can be broken down into two
categories: 1) Content biases, which are specific to what is
being learned, (e.g., selective retention of fitness relevant
information over non-fitness relevant information) and 2)
Context biases that pertain not to what is being
transmitted, but rather to the context in which it is transmitted,
including both who is transmitting and how this information is
distributed across the population. Both analytical and simulation
models have shown how these types of biases may produce adaptive
change over time within populations, by increasing the likelihood
that an individual acquires the variants of a cultural trait that
are more likely to be adaptive on the whole. While these models
have enhanced our understanding of the potential dynamics of
different patterns of cultural transmission, and are supported by
ethnographic observations from a variety of contexts as well as
laboratory evidence, little detailed field data have directly
tested the predictions from these models in real world settings. My
dissertation is an attempt to bridge this gap, by directly
examining several predictions from formal models among Fijian
villagers. I accomplish this with 3 studies, each designed to
explore a different area of the predictions from these models
through the integration of experimental tools with quantitative
ethnographic methods.","Chapter 1-General Introduction

.................................................... 18 -- Context
biases in cultural transmission have been proposed to be one manner

55 -- In this chapter, I tie chapter 2 and 3 together; by

-- of another type of bias in cultural transmission, content
biases. -- Chapter 3- Content Biases in Learning about Novel

","ABSTRACT
Structure and Function of the Escherichia coli
RNA-Binding Global Regulatory Protein CsrA
By
Jeffrey W. Mercante
In Escherichia coli K12, the small RNA-binding protein,
CsrA, is the central component of a
pathway that has pleiotropic effects on cellular processes such as
carbon metabolism, motility and biofilm
formation. CsrA binds to the 5'-untranslated leader of mRNA
transcripts and, in repressed messages,
inhibits ribosome access and thus translation. At the outset of
this project, little was known about the
structure of CsrA except that it was a homodimer. Therefore, a
comprehensive alanine-scanning
mutagenesis of the protein was undertaken to determine which amino
acids were important for RNA-
binding and regulation of gene expression. Two regions of the
protein were identified where mutations
caused a dramatic affect on CsrA activity. Region 1 was found at
the N-terminus (1, residues 2-7) of the
protein while region 2 was situated close to the C-terminus (5,
residues 40-47). When these regions were
mapped to a recently determined 3D CsrA structure two RNA-binding
subdomains were defined on
opposite sides of the bilaterally symmetrical protein; each
subdomain consisted of 1 from one subunit
positioned adjacent and parallel to 5 from the other subunit in
three-dimensional space. Critical amino
acids that make up the binding surfaces, including the most
important residue, R44, were found to be
highly conserved in all species examined. Construction of a
heterodimer CsrA protein (HD-CsrA) that
contains only a single normally functioning RNA-binding surface and
EMSA studies revealed that CsrA
has the capacity to bind one or two independent RNA molecules.
Furthermore, CsrA can interact with two
RNA target sites within the same RNA oligonucleotide simultaneously
(dual binding). A distance of 18
nucleotides was established as optimal spacing between targets to
allow for dual binding. Finally, a native
E. coli CsrA target that contains multiple binding sites,
glgCAP, was repressed ~14-fold more efficiently
in
vitro from the wild-type CsrA dimer than by HD-CsrA. When
one CsrA target site was deleted in the
glgCAP leader, repression by wild-type CsrA decreased while
HD-CsrA regulation was unchanged, thus
establishing that dual binding has biological relevance.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Chapter 1. Introduction --

published,emory:92cbz,"Stevenson, Edward G.J.","Schooling and life chances: Explaining the effects of mothers'
schooling on children's health in Ethiopia","The expansion of women's schooling is often asserted to be one
of the largest influences on the global fall in child mortality of
the past century. While consensus exists that the benefits of
maternal schooling for child survival are due to improved health
behaviors on the part of mothers, the factors that connect girls'
school experience to these behaviors in later life are unclear.
This dissertation tested 4 hypothetical connections between
schooling and child health in Ethiopia, namely (1) knowledge of
treatments for diarrhea and malaria, (2) literacy skills, (3)
aspirations that could motivate greater parental investment, and
(4) greater wealth and access to medical services among mothers
with more education. The research was carried out in the town of
Jimma and neighboring rural areas, and included approximately 120
hours of observation in primary schools and an 18-month
longitudinal survey of ~140 children, aged 0-33 months, with
varying levels of parental schooling. Children's illnesses,
physical growth, and psychomotor development status were used as
measures of mortality risk. 
Living in rural communities, where there was neither piped water
nor easy access to medical services, had larger negative effects on
children's health than lack of parents' schooling. Knowledge,
literacy, and aspirations showed variable relationships to
children's health outcomes: fathers' health literacy appeared to
mediate the relationship between paternal schooling and children's
weight gain in the urban setting, while mothers' schooling and
aspirations for children's development were related to greater
weight for age among children in the rural settings. Lower odds of
diarrhea among children of mothers with schooling in the rural
communities could not be explained by any of the hypothesized
mechanisms. In sum, parents' schooling did not exhibit consistent
relationships to child health outcomes or to the hypothesized
mediators. Community-level factors such as access to clean water
and medical services may overwhelm the potential benefits for
children's health that might otherwise follow from mothers'
schooling. Investments in education should therefore be matched by
provision of amenities to underserved communities, and by efforts
to reduce the barriers to accessing healthcare faced by
marginalized parents and children.","-- List of tables and figures -- Note on transcription and names --

mechanism remains unclear. In this thesis, we present a detailed
molecular study to reveal mechanistic insights of our model
theophylline riboswitch. This study helps to construct the
first biophysical model of synthetic riboswitch that has predictive
power. Meanwhile, the kinetic aspect of riboswitch mechanism
is analyzed to support the hypothesis that riboswitch
function contains both thermodynamic and kinetic components.
Furthermore, we implement our biophysical model to design a
novel class of synthetic tetramethylrosamine riboswitches.
Detailed characterization of these riboswitches is provided
to illustrate their mechanism and guide further applications. Each
chapter reveals one aspect of riboswitch function and

published,emory:bq58d,"Hazera, Eduardo Iskender","Creating Stylistic Identity through Musical Hybridity in North
India: Histories, Politics, and Theories for the Benares
Gharana","When a classical vocalist starts singing at a concert in North
India, the audience can often
hear the vocalist's hereditary identity. Audience members
may commend the musician for
authentically performing his genealogical style or perhaps deride
him for modifying his
ancestors' aesthetics. Such hereditary sounds emerged within
gharana lineages that were formed
in the early nineteenth-century. Typically, gharanas create
distinct artistic identities by
maintaining a specific set of musical characteristics across
multiple generations. For example,
vocalists in the Agra gharana created a consistent musical
persona by maintaining a style of
open-throated vocal projections over the past six generations.
Almost every other gharana
reflects this process in which collective identity emerges through
the maintenance of distinct
musical sounds. Conversely, vocalists in the Benares gharana
create a unified audible identity by
hybridizing a diversity of musical characteristics instead of
perpetuating a singular stylistic
sound. For instance, while taking voice lessons in Calcutta, I
learned about the ways in which
Benares gharana vocalists integrated the melodic sentiments
of semi-classical genres with
formal structures from high-classical genres. I explore such
examples of musical hybridity in the
Benares gharana by outlining two broad categories of
sociomusical activity in the early
nineteenth-century. Afterwards, I situate my ethnographic data on
the musical identity of the
Benares gharana within the interstitial space between these
two broad categories. To offer an
interpretive solution to the ambiguity of this in-between identity,
I deploy the history of musical
patronage in the Mughal Empire and examine the transformations were
enacted by British
colonialism. Finally, I argue that the interstitial musical
identity that developed in this colonial
period does not conform to the liberal theoretical paradigms of
hybridity and liminality. Rather,
the ambiguous musical identity of the Benares gharana
demands an understanding of hybridity
as a form of hegemony: the musical identity of the Benares
gharana is an embodiment of the
political tool of artistic hybridity that was patronized by two
rulers in the city of Benares during
the nineteenth century in order to create an insular identity for
their citizens that could emerge as
an organized political entity to confront British
imperialism.","Table of Contents -- Prefacing and Acknowledging ----- 1 -- Ch. 1)

Brightness?","Although prosody (the rhythm, intonation, and rate of speech)
has been assumed to have no direct impact on the processing of
meaning, recent studies have shown that language users may be
sensitive to prosodic cues to meaning in spoken language,
suggesting that prosody may impact how we produce and perceive
semantic information in speech. The current study examined one
potential example of non-arbitrary sound to meaning mapping that
may be reflected in prosody, the correspondence between sound and
color. Two experiments examined the extent to which speakers
spontaneously produce prosodic correlates to meaning when
describing color and brightness. In Experiment 1, participants
produced verbal labels for different colors and brightness levels
using actual color names. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
similar task using novel words for color labels. Acoustic analyses
in Experiment 1 showed that speakers' prosody reliably differed
across color labels. Further, labels for cool colors (purple, blue,
and green) were significantly higher in pitch and amplitude than
those for warm colors (yellow, orange, and red). However, the same
differences were not found in Experiment 2. Findings suggest a
complex relationship between prosody and meaning, which may be
attributed to different types of auditory and visual mappings.","Introduction

Interpreting On and Off-Screen Lesbianism:
A Case Study of Emory University College Students
By Zoe DuPree Fine
Television is a powerful agent of socialization in our culture,
a structure that
reflects back to society that which is appropriate and acceptable,
and a medium that
presents images of lesbians infrequently and in limited ways. I
investigate how young
audience members of today make meaning of lesbian images on
television, how they feel
about lesbians in reality, and how their social locations relate to
both their views and
interpretations. This thesis examines how Emory University College
students interpret
lesbian representation on television today.

I created and distributed an online survey that asked respondents
to report basic
information about themselves, their attitudes about lesbians in
reality, and their
interpretations of lesbian TV representations. The survey requested
information about
Emory College students' social locations with questions about their
same-sex attraction,
gender, proximity/contact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer
(LGBQ) people,
religiosity, and socio-economic status (SES), and I analyzed these
variables in relation to
students' individual interpretations of lesbian TV portrayals and
their attitudes about
lesbians in reality. With feminist, sociological, and media theory,
I examine how young
audiences of today who occupy different social locations feel about
lesbians on and off
the television screen. This thesis begins with an historical
overview of lesbians on
American television, and concludes with an analysis of my collected
quantitative data.","Table of Contents -- Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

published,emory:d834t,"Moscow, Josh",Compliance with the Regular Order in the U.S. Senate,"The rules and precedents of the U.S. House of Representatives
and the Senate establish a ""regular order"" in the legislative
process, but many have noted a trend in which deviation from the
regular order is becoming more common and a bill's path through
Congress can be chaotic and unpredictable. This phenomenon is
evident in the Senate, where a traditional emphasis on deliberation
and minority rights has been threatened by many unorthodox
procedures. This trend raises two questions: Why should the Senate
follow the regular order? And why does the Senate follow or not
follow the regular order in the legislative process?
Using an original measure that tracks the occurrence of several
types of such unorthodox procedures, this study uses quantitative
evidence to confirm that violations of the regular order are
increasing. From 2008 to 2010, violations occurred with greater
frequency than at any point in the previous 29 years. Increases in
centralization in particular as well as the length of the Senate's
legislative sessions provide the greatest leverage in explaining
the upward trend in violations. Contrary to expectations, increased
partisan polarization and the presence of electoral cycle years
have no direct effect on increased violations. Moreover, while
partisan polarization is highly correlated with centralization,
systematic multivariate analysis clearly demonstrates that
centralization explains most of the variance in violations. These
findings motivate future inquiries that explore the roles of
centralization and time in the regular order and legislative
decision-making.","I.

Critical Philosophy:
Immanuel Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason
By
Colin McQuillan
Critical Philosophy: Immanuel Kant and the Critique of Pure
Reason examines the concept of ""critique,"" as it is employed by
Immanuel Kant in the Critique
of Pure Reason (1781/1787). While many readers assume that Kant
intended the Critique of Pure Reason to
establish the limits of reason, my dissertation shows that the work
attempts to determine the possibility
of a science of metaphysics through a critique of the faculty of
human reason. The critical approach to
metaphysics that Kant develops in the Critique of Pure Reason is
novel, because critique had been a
primarily philological concept in the eighteenth century, when it
was associated with the authentication
of ancient texts and the determination of their sources. Kant
appropriated the term in the early 1770's,
applying it to a problem with which he had been concerned since the
time of his earliest, ""pre-critical""
works. This is the problem of the proper method of metaphysics. The
discussions of a critique of pure
reason that are to be found in Kant's notes, lectures, and
correspondence, as well as the Critique of Pure
Reason itself, afford us a unique insight into the development of
Kant's ""critical"" philosophy, when we
realize that they are the direct result of Kant's application of
the concept of critique to problem of the
proper method of metaphysics. By examining these texts, my
dissertation helps scholars to understand
the reasons why Kant thought the possibility of a science of
metaphysics depended upon the
determination and authentication of the sources of metaphysics in
the faculties of human reason. It
provides a historical and contextual account of the development of
Kant's critical philosophy which is
unique in the scholarly literature.

Micronutrient biomarkers of Nutrition Status Influence the Risk of
TB in US Men
and Women: NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study

By Farah Srichandra

Background: One third of the world's population is thought
to be infected with
tuberculosis (TB), and new infections occur at a rate of about one
per second. The
proportion of people who become sick with TB each year is stable or
falling in different
regions of the world, but, because of population growth, the
absolute number of new
cases is still increasing. Undernutrition is an important risk
factor for TB, but, primarily,
studies have been conducted on anthropometric measures for
nutritional status and few
studies have used biomarkers for nutritional status.

Objective: This research analyzes the risk of developing TB
in relation to micronutrient
biomarkers of nutritional status. Our specific interest is whether
micronutrient biomarkers
of nutritional status at baseline are related to the incidence of
TB during the follow-up of
10 to 20 years.

Methods: In the NHANES-1 epidemiological follow-up study,a
nationally representative
data set of 14,407 adults who were followed up on 3 to 4 occasions
over a period of 10 to
20 years. Secondary data analysis was carried out using SAS
statistical software, to
examine the relationship between deficiencies in hemoglobin,
albumin, vitamins A,
iron and the incidence of TB. The primary dependent variable is
incidence of TB during the follow - up period.

Results: Anemia and low serum albumin are independent risk
factors for physician
diagnosed TB, and it's magnitude of effect is 3.02 (1.44, 6.34) 95%
CI.As a result, the chances of
developing TB increase by 3-fold for persons who are anemic.
Vitamin A was not associated with physician diagnosed TB.

Discussion: The longitudinal cohort study provides data on a
large national sample, it presents a unique opportunity for health
researchers to study changes in health status and the factors that
contribute to good health as well as illness. This study provides
implications to address the importance of micronutrient biomarkers
as a way to combat TB globally.","Table of Contents -- I. Introduction

Cousins of Faith
By David Micley
Cousins of Faith is an ethnographic documentary juxtaposing and
comparing the daily life of an
observant Muslim and an observant Jew living in Atlanta. The film
covers themes of identity,
religion, and family, and addresses how these ideas play out in the
American context.","Page 1- Part 1: Analysis of documentary film with reference to

diarrheal disease in children during a complex humanitarian
emergency","Background: A complex humanitarian
emergency (CHE) involves a complete breakdown of authority that
goes beyond the mandate or response capacity of any single country
or United Nations agency. Diarrheal diseases are often a principal
cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five during a
CHE. Rotavirus causes up to 40% of diarrhea cases in Africa. Two
vaccines for rotavirus are safe and effective in children. The goal
of the first aim of this thesis was to assess if rotavirus
vaccination would be cost-effective during a CHE. The goal of the
second aim was to determine correlates of diarrhea disease in
children under five in Somalia.
Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis
was performed comparing no vaccine, one-dose, or two-doses of
rotavirus vaccine. A univariate sensitivity analysis was carried
out to examine the extent to which the uncertainty in the variables
affects our estimates. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER) to compare no vaccination to one- or two-doses of rotavirus
vaccine was performed. For aim two, data was from the 2005-2006
MICS3. The outcome was diarrhea among children under five in past
two weeks. Variables included child's age, gender, vitamin A
receipt, measles vaccination, polio vaccine, any vaccine, vaccine
refusal, breastfeeding, maternal hygiene behaviors, and water
treatment.
Results: Variables influencing the
ICER most were vaccine effectiveness and access to outpatient and
inpatient care. Rotavirus vaccination would avert up to 12,469
deaths and would save $71,124 in medical treatment costs. The
base-case ICER was $17.76 per life saved. For aim two, in the
unadjusted analysis, gender, age, measles/MMR vaccine, receipt of
any vaccine, washing hands before feeding child, and washing hands
after cleaning baby's bottom were all associated with diarrheal
disease. The final model consisted of age, gender, receipt of any
vaccine, and washing hands after cleaning baby's bottom. The kappa
statistic for the model's ability to predict a case was
0.1304.
Conclusions: Rotavirus vaccination
is a ""very cost-effective"" intervention, as defined by WHO as
â‰¤ 1 per captia GDP (Somalia $220.30). Targeted
interventions to prevent diarrheal diseases in children under five
during a CHE should focus on vaccination and maternal hygiene
behaviors.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I:

How Children Use Landmarks in a Geometrical Space

The present study borrows from Graham et al. (2006) to address the
conflicting theories
that exist about the use of both geometry and landmarks in
children. Across both 3- and
4-year-olds, there was improvement in performance in using the
geometry of a kite-
shaped space (no landmark trials) when they were exposed previously
to featural cues,
specifically, different colored walls in this space (landmark
trials). This means that
learning about the shape of a fairly complex enclosure was affected
by the color of the
walls in that shape. Together, these findings question the validity
of a geometric module,
which must be addressed in future studies.

Thy Will Lord, Not Mine: Parents, Grief, and Child Death in the
Antebellum South
By Katherine McVane Armstrong
This dissertation investigates the emotions and experiences of
planter-class
parents in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia as
they grieved the
death of a child. Through analysis of prescriptive and consolation
literature, sermons,
periodicals, and especially the letters and diaries of bereft
parents and the friends and
family they turned to for support, I argue southern parents'
profound difficulty aligning
their feelings of loss with the expectations of their society
defined their grief. Of these
expectations, the idea that mothers and fathers must resign
themselves to God's will-
that they must say, ""Thy will be done""- was the most pervasive, the
most crucial, and
the most difficult for grieving parents to meet.
Though all too common, the death of a child was a crushing event in
the lives of
antebellum southern parents that left mothers and fathers deeply
saddened, often guilt-
ridden or angry, and bewildered with the meaning of their lives in
the midst of loss. The
need to grieve in accordance with southern cultural dictates only
exacerbated these
emotions. Still, antebellum southerners' fought to do so, concerned
with their honor and
determined to demonstrate their piety and their adherence to gender
ideals.
A child's death, her parents' grief, and the tension both catalyzed
between
southerners and their culture changed the tenor of plantation life,
altering dynamics
between husbands and wives, parents and children, brothers and
sisters, and masters and
slaves.

Exploring Differences in Weight Perception among Blacks and
Whites
By Yolanda Hendley
Background: The prevalence of obesity is higher in
blacks than whites, especially in black women, and is a major
contributor to ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Weight perception may contribute to these differences if blacks are
more likely to underestimate their weight. We explored race and
gender differences in underestimation of weight, after adjusting
for other cardiovascular risk factors
Methods: The META-Health Study (Morehouse and
Emory Team up to eliminate cardiovascular Health disparities) is a
2-stage study including a random-digit-dialing and phone interview
of white and black residents of metro Atlanta, aged 30-66, followed
by a clinic visit with detailed testing in a subsample. A total of
3391 individuals were interviewed. Of these, 219 white and 240
black men and women underwent detailed testing. Perceived weight
status was assessed over the phone with the question: ""How do you
describe your weight? Would you say underweight, about the right
weight, overweight, or obese?"" Height, weight, and waist
circumference (WC) were measured and body mass index (BMI) was
calculated. Logistic regression was used to compare the likelihood
of underestimating actual weight category by race, before and after
adjusting for socidodemographic, lifestyle factors, and medical
history.
Results: Blacks compared with Whites
were on average younger, had higher financial stress, and were less
likely to be college graduates. Both blacks and whites largely
underestimated their weight, but blacks underestimated weight more
than whites (64.1% vs. 32.4%). In multivariate analysis, the odds
of underestimating BMI category was greater than threefold in
blacks compared with whites [OR (95% CI) 3.3 (95% CI,
2.1-5.1) ] and was larger for black women than for
black men (p&lt;0.01 for interaction). When taking into account fat
distribution by utilizing WC as a measure of weight, the observed
difference in weight underestimation remained.
Conclusion: Our data suggest a
pervasive attitude toward acceptance of excess weight among blacks,
particularly black women, who have the highest burden of obesity.
Educational efforts aimed at decreasing obesity among blacks should
be targeted towards ameliorating weight misperception and improving
knowledge of obesity-associated risks.",Table of Contents
published,emory:fw7nk,"Kasbekar, Chirag","Essays on the Impact of the Geographic Concentration of Industries
on Competition and Knowledge Spillovers","The two essays that constitute this dissertation examine
the impact of geographic concentration on organization mortality
and relocation. The geographic distribution of an industry
determines geographical variation in the performance of
organizations within it. In the first essay (""Local Competition,
Mortality and Relocation: Geographic Concentration in the US
Firearms Industry, 1790-1914""), I argue that a positive
relationship between mortality and geographic concentration need
not be caused by lower performance in concentrated areas relative
to other areas. To test this argument, I use organizational
relocation to construct and conduct an â€˜escape
valve' test of local competition in the context of the US firearms
industry. The results of the test indicate that organizational
relocation and higher mortality rates are not driven by lower
performance in dense areas. I put forward an alternative
explanation for the results based on the idea that industry exit
and and relocation are determined by entrepreneurial and
organizational performance thresholds that are affected by
geographic variation in opportunity costs. An increasing body of
evidence suggests that the costs and benefits of locating in
proximity to geographic concentrations of an industry depend on the
local industrial organization. In the second essay (""Geographic
Concentration and the Local History of Industrial Organization:
Postbellum Firearms Firms in the Southern United States""), I argue
that they also depend on the previous forms of local industrial
organization experienced by organizations proximate to the focal
firm. I use the US Civil War as an exogenous institutional shock
that briefly changed the industrial organization of the firearms
industry in the US South and created two groups of firms in the
post-War period--those with experience of the shock and those
without. Within this post-War period, I examine differences between
the effects of concentrations of Civil War firms and the effects of
concentrations of post-Civil War firms on organizational mortality
and provide evidence in support of my argument.","-- Page --

High Resolution THz Spectroscopy of Astrophysically Relevant
Ions
Ions and radicals are thought to play fundamental roles in the
complex chem-
istry of the interstellar medium (ISM). Identiﬁcation of
these species in interstellar
environments hinges on the availability of accurate laboratory
spectra with which to
compare. The work presented here is focused on developing equipment
and tech-
niques to study these species, with an aim towards the eventual
acquisition of the
rotational spectrum of protonated methanol, an elusive organic ion
that is thought to
be central to gas-phase organic chemical processes in the ISM.
Protonated methanol
is a highly ﬂuxional molecule, and this study will progress
not only our knowledge
of its eﬀects on interstellar chemistry, but also our
fundamental understanding of the
intramolecular motion in organic molecules that guides reaction
mechanisms. In or-
der to achieve this goal, I have designed new supersonic expansion
discharge sources
that will favor protonation of organic molecules, combined these
sources with multi-
pass direct-absorption spectroscopy systems, and worked towards the
development of
a new, high-resolution, high-sensitivity spectrometer that operates
in the terahertz
(THz) range. I have also conducted numerous broadband spectral line
surveys of
a variety of interstellar sources to develop a catalog for rapid
identiﬁcation of new
molecules as laboratory data becomes available.","1 Introduction 1 -- 1.1 Laboratory Background . . . . . . . . . . .

published,emory:d726x,"Rump, Jacob Martin","The Phenomenological Dimension of the Theory of Meaning: a
Critical Inquiry through Husserl and Wittgenstein","Given the undeniable influence of the linguistic turn, it is
common to characterize epistemology in the twentieth century as
centrally concerned with meaning. But many of the early
twentieth-century figures who helped to inspire that turn did not
characterize meaning exclusively in terms of language. In response
to contemporary accounts that tend to limit the scope of meaning to
the semantic, pragmatic or conceptual, I use the work of Husserl
and Wittgenstein to argue for the importance of non-linguistic
aspects of lived experience (Erlebnis) to the theory of
meaning, situating the project historically as a legacy of Kant's
Critical epistemology and systematically in terms of contemporary
debates about the role and status of nonconceptual content.
I argue in Chapter One that a robust theory of meaning must take
account of the way the conditions of the possibility for meaning
are determined by intrinsically value-bearing features of everyday
experience, features that are not themselves inherently linguistic
or conceptual. Most contemporary nonconceptualist accounts of
perceptual experience fail to adequately theorize the role of the
nonconceptual on its own terms, reducing nonconceptual elements of
experience to that of mere ""fodder"" for conceptualization and
ignoring the epistemic role the nonconceptual plays in determining
structural conditions of possibility. This can be overcome through
a transcendental-constitutional approach that examines the full
range of experiential structures--including those not mediated by
language or concepts--by which meaning is constituted.
Tracing a series of parallel developments in the theories of
meaning of Husserl and Wittgenstein in Chapters Two through Five, I
argue that--despite important differences--both authors' later
conceptions of meaning necessarily include accounts of its relation
to an inexact, non-linguistic dimension of experiential life: the
lifeworld (Husserl) or form(s) of life
(Wittgenstein). What appears from the standpoint of linguistic and
conceptual analysis to be an unfortunate inexactness is in terms of
the later conceptions of both philosophers not the result of
incomplete analysis, but of a recognition of the ontological
primacy of the lived and fundamentally social phenomenon of
meaningfulness that characterizes our experience in a way
that outstrips conceptual and linguistic representation.","Chapter One: Introduction -- I. Terminological Preliminaries and

published,emory:bnwwx,"Desmond, Kenneth Wayne","Structure, Dynamics, and Forces of Jammed Systems","The first system we study is a concentrated binary colloidal
suspensions. We use con-
focal microscopy to directly observe particle motion within dense
samples with packing
fractions ranging from 0.40-0.59. To study temporal fluctuations we
use the dynamic sus-
ceptibility χ4, and find that the dynamical
heterogeneity of the small and larger particles
are qualitatively similar with the smaller particles undergoing
slightly larger fluctuations
relative to their size. The temporal fluctuations give rise to
length scales and time scales
which grow as the jamming transition is approached, although the
form of this growth is
ambiguous with respect to power-law or exponential growth.
The second system we study is random packing of disks and spheres
within confined
geometries. Studies of random close packing have advanced our
knowledge about the struc-
ture of systems such as liquids, glasses, emulsions, granular
media, and amorphous solids.
When these systems are confined, their structural properties
change. To understand these
changes we study random close packing in finite-sized confined
systems, in both two and
three dimensions. The presence of confining walls significantly
lowers the overall maximum
area fraction (or volume fraction in three dimensions). A simple
model is presented which
quantifies the reduction in packing due to wall-induced structure.
This wall-induced struc-
ture decays rapidly away from the wall, with characteristic length
scales comparable to the
small particle diameter.
The final system we explore is a new quasi-two-dimensional model
system we have
developed to probe the jamming transition. Our system consist of
confining oil-in-water
emulsion droplets between two parallel plates, so that the droplets
are squeezed into quasi-
two dimensional disks, analogous to granular photoelastic disks.
These droplets have no
static friction and are highly deformable. To quantify the internal
forces in our experiments,
we present an experimental protocol to determine the force law for
droplets in contact. We
use our model system to characterize various critical scaling
phenomena associated with the
jamming transition and the force chain network. We also flow our
quasi-2D emulsions in
a flow geometry analogous to pure shear to better understand the
microscopic events and
stress relaxations within jammed materials.","1 Introduction -- 1.1 The Jamming Transition . . . . . . . . . . .

published,emory:fj235,"Carlson, Susan","Burden of Inadequate Levels of Physical Activity in the United
States","Despite the health benefits of physical activity, less
than half of U.S. adults meet current aerobic physical activity
guidelines and almost one-third of adults are physically
inactive. Levels of physical activity
inadequate to meet guidelines (i.e., inactive and
insufficiently active) can be a substantial public
health burden in the U.S.
The first article examined the association
between inadequate physical activity and health care
expenditures. Compared to being physically active, the
mean difference (after adjusting for covariates and body mass index
category) in annual health care expenditures was $1248 (percent
difference: 26.6%) for those inactive and $661 (percent difference:
14.4%) for those insufficiently active. Overall, 11.5% of
aggregate health care expenditures were associated with inadequate
physical activity. When adults who reported any difficulty
walking due to a health problem were excluded, the mean difference
for those inactive was $871 (percent difference: 20.7%) and $504
(percent difference: 11.7%) for those insufficiently active. After
this exclusion, 8.9% of health care expenditures were associated
with inadequate physical activity.
The second article estimated the
percentage of depression- and anxiety-specific health care
expenditures associated with inadequate physical activity using
both attributable fraction (AF) and regression based (RB)
approaches. The percentage of depression- and
anxiety-specific health care expenditures associated with
inadequate physical activity was significantly higher (21.2%) when
using the RB approach than with the AF approach (11.1%). Percentage
estimates were higher when examining depression and anxiety
separately with the RB approach (depression: 21.9%, anxiety: 17.2%)
compared to the AF approach (depression: 13.2%, anxiety: 7.5%);
however, differences were not significant.
The third article estimated the percentage of premature
deaths attributable to inadequate physical activity.
For adults age 40-69 and 70 or older, inactive (hazard ratio
(HR) for 40-69: 1.24; 70+: 1.19) and insufficiently active adults
(HR for 40-69: 1.11; 70+: 1.12) had an increased risk of mortality
compared to active adults. Among adults age 25-39, there was no
association between levels of physical activity and mortality.
Among adults 40-69, 10.1% of premature deaths in the U.S. were
attributed to inadequate physical activity. Among adults 70 or
older, 9.0% of deaths were attributed to inadequate physical
activity.","Chapter 1: Motivation and Key Research Question...1 --

Human Capital Development","Abstract
The Effects of Asymmetric and Symmetric Fetal Growth Restriction on
Human
Capital Development
This study explores the causal pathway by which poor fetal health
translates into
reducing educational attainment and earnings as an adult. Using
insights from
the medical literature, I decompose low birth weight infants into
two distinct
subtypes: a symmetric type, which is characterized by cognitive
deficits, and an
asymmetric type, which exhibits little to no cognitive problems.
Using data from
a longitudinal survey of newborns, I establish three results:
First, there is
empirical evidence of brain sparing in the asymmetric subtype, but
not in the
symmetric subtype. Second, despite differences in cognitive
impairment, both
subtypes exhibit similar impairment to physical health. And
finally, there is
evidence that the causes and timing of onset during pregnancy are
different for
asymmetric and symmetric growth restriction. These results indicate
that
differentiating between these subtypes may offer new opportunities
to identify the
underlying casual relationships between health and human capital
development,
as well as uncovering the ""black box"" mechanism behind the fetal
origins
hypothesis. In a separate analysis using Census micro-data and
utilizing a
historical ""natural experiment"", I show that symmetric growth
restriction, but not
asymmetric growth restriction, is associated with decreased
education and
earnings as an adult. In addition to the academic implications,
these results also
have broad implications for the timing of policy interventions
aimed at pregnant
women.","Contents -- 1 Introduction. . . 1 -- 2 Background. . . 3 -- 2.1 The

published,emory:fzrd9,"Richards, Sarah",The Austro-Comedy and the Brenner Trilogy,"Austrian director Wolfgang Murnberger, author Wolf Haas, and
comedian/actor Josef Hader have collaborated on three recent films
based on Haas' best-selling detective novels: Come, Sweet
Death (2000), Silentium! (2004), and The Bone Man
(2009). All three films have been critically acclaimed and stand
among the top ten most successful domestic films at the Austrian
box office since Austria's national film subsidy began in 1981.
While they can be considered part of the national film renaissance
known as New Austrian Film, these are commercial popular films
meant to entertain a domestic audience. All are also exemplars of a
local genre, the Austro-comedy, which has developed out of the
Austrian tradition of the Volksstueck, or folk play, and
which takes a self-critical perspective towards Austria. This
project attempts to situate the three Brenner films within the
Austrian film industry and ""translate"" them for an American
audience by providing historical and cultural context. In addition,
it investigates each of the three films as an example of the
Austro-comedy, an adaptation of a novel, and a specifically
Austrian work of art. The analysis of Come, Sweet Death
centers on the characterization of its anti-hero protagonist, Simon
Brenner, familiar to local audiences from the books but appearing
on-screen for the first time; the depiction of his milieu, the
non-touristy side of Vienna; and the establishment of an unusual
film language to adapt the remarkable voice of Wolf Haas' narrator
into a different medium. Silentium! is considered in light
of the ways in which it disrupts Austria's well-known guiding
narratives, putting the lie to stereotypes of Salzburg as simply a
tourist's Baroque paradise (and the setting for The Sound of
Music and the glamorous Salzburger Festspiele) and
questioning, if not smashing, people's trust in long-standing
institutions such as the Catholic Church. The investigation of
The Bone Man focuses on the use of Austrian dialect as a
cultural marker and unpacks the two key sets of tensions, between
Austria and neighboring countries and between Vienna and the
provincial countryside, that collide in a masquerade ball at the
end of the film.","Introduction: 1 -- Chapter One: 14 -- The Austro-Comedy in Context

The Changing Epidemiology of Invasive Haemophilus
influenzae Disease in
Metropolitan Atlanta during the Hib Vaccine Era,
1989-2008

By Daniel Livorsi, MD

Background: An effective Haemophilus influenzae type
b (Hib) conjugate vaccine was
licensed in the U.S. for use in young children in 1987 and infants
in 1990. We describe
changes in the epidemiology of invasive H. influenzae (HI)
disease after Hib vaccine
introduction and evaluate predictors of mortality.
Methods: Population-based, active surveillance was
conducted for HI in metropolitan
Atlanta, GA between 1/1/89 and 12/31/08.
Results: A total of 1207 cases of HI were identified
during 1989-2008. The incidence of
HI decreased significantly between 1989 and 2008 (5.1 to 1.1 cases
per 100K, χ2 trend
p&lt;0.001). Rates of HI decreased significantly in all age groups
except those ≥ 65 yrs.
The largest absolute decline of HI was in infants &lt; 2 yrs (90.9
to 6.4 cases per 100K, χ2
trend p&lt;0.001). Rates of Hib disease decreased in children (99%
decrease, χ2 trend
p&lt;0.001) and adults (96% decrease, χ2 trend p&lt;0.001).
Rates of capsule type f increased
in adults (205% increase, χ2 trend p=0.04).
The median age for HI cases was 10 months in children and 60
years in adults. Seventy-
one percent of adults and 23% of children had underlying
conditions. The relative risk of
HI was higher in blacks than whites: 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.7). Children
accounted for 73%
of cases in 1989-1990 but only 24% in 2000-2008. In 1989-1990, Hib
caused 85% of HI
disease in children and 56% in adults. During 2000-2008, the most
common isolates
were either nontypeable (66%) and type f (24%).
Overall in-hospital mortality rate was 12% (7% in children, 16%
in adults). On
multivariate analysis of cases from 2000-2008, risk factors for
in-hospital death included
age &lt; 2 years, age ≥ 40 years, bacteremia without an
identified focus, and nontypeable
disease.
Conclusion: Since introduction of the Hib
conjugate vaccine, the incidence of HI disease
has significantly decreased in all age groups except ≥ 65
years. Hib disease has declined
in children and non-immunized adults. HI is now primarily a disease
of adults with
chronic diseases due to nontypeable and type f strains. In-hospital
death with invasive HI
infection was associated with the extremes of age and infection
with nontypeable strains.","Table of Contents: -- Introduction.....1 -- Background.....3 --

utilities","Abstract
Objective : To compare the quality of life impact
of chronic pruritus to that of chronic pain using
directly elicited health utilities
Design: Cross-sectional study
Setting: Convenience sample of patients attending the Emory
Dermatology Clinic, Emory Spine
Center, and Emory Center for Pain Management.
Participants: Adult men and women (≥18 years)
experiencing chronic pain or pruritus for a
minimum of 6 weeks
Main Outcome Measure: The mean utility score of subjects
with chronic pruritus was
compared to that of subjects with chronic pain. A regression
analysis was performed to
determine the impact of the primary predictor variable, symptom
type, on the primary outcome
variable, mean utility score (a measurement for quality of life
impact)
Results: 73 subjects with chronic pruritus and 138 subjects
with chronic pain were recruited.
Mean (SD) utility among patients with pruritus was 0.874 (0.27)
compared to 0.767 (0.31) for
subjects with pain (p&lt;0.001). After controlling for symptom
severity, duration, and demographic
factors, only symptom severity (-0.03, p=0.048) and single marital
status (-0.12, p= 0.02) and not
symptom type (0.05, p= 0.43) remained a significant predictor of
mean utility score.
Conclusions : Chronic pruritus has substantial
quality of life impact which may be comparable to
that of pain. Symptom severity and support networks are important
factors in determining the
extent of quality of life impact. Addressing support networks in
addition to developing new
therapies may improve the quality of life of itchy patients.","-- I.

Spinoza's Way of Ideas
One of Spinoza's most important, yet elusive, philosophical
innovations is his concept of
an adequate idea, which he defines as one with the intrinsic marks
of its truth. My dissertation
explores adequacy at the intersection of Spinoza's theories of
ideas and knowledge.
In the first part of the dissertation, I develop an interpretation
of adequacy, according to
which an idea is adequate if it is thought through its cause, such
that all the properties of the
object can be deduced therefrom. I highlight the difficulties this
epistemic model must face
when applied to the knowledge of natural things (and not just
mathematical objects), and I
discuss Spinoza's arguments against skepticism.
In the second part of the dissertation, I develop successive
interpretations of Spinoza's
three kinds of knowledge from the standpoint of his theory of
adequacy. I show how the second
and third kinds of knowledge (reason and intuitive science) exhibit
the scope for adequate
knowledge of natural things.
Throughout the dissertation I explain and argue for the
sophistication of Spinoza's
methodology. I show that Spinoza is sensitive to the need to
balance an a priori conception of
the nature of knowledge with a naturalistic understanding of human
cognitive capacities; and as
such, Spinoza exemplifies an approach avant la lettre to the
problem of naturalizing
epistemology.

published,emory:13zxv,"Turner, Bethany Lynn", THE SERVANTS OF MACHU PICCHU: LIFE HISTORIES AND POPULATION DYNAMICS IN LATE HORIZON PERU  ,"This study elucidates variation in early-life diet and geographic origin among the population from the Inca site of Machu Picchu, Peru. In use during the 15th and 16th centuries, Machu Picchu was one of several royal estates inhabited by permanent servants, though their specific social class was unknown. A central aspect of political economy in the Inca Empire was the large-scale relocation of populations, in different numbers and different ways according to assigned social class. Moreover, the Inca used particular social classes, such as the mitmacona, acllacona and yanacona, to circumvent traditional reciprocal obligations of elites to their subjects; the ability to accurately profile these different social classes in Inca-period skeletal populations, given that they were moved around the empire in different ways, stands to drastically improve interpretations of demography and function in ancient Andean populations. However, identifying population movement in ancient populations is difficult, due to the limitations and ambiguities inherent to common forms of archaeological and osteological evidence. Recently, isotopic analysis has shown promise in resolving this issue in Europe and parts of Mesoamerica, but this research is in its infancy in Andean South America. The Machu Picchu skeletal population is large, well-preserved and archaeologically well-contextualized; based on mortuary and osteological analyses, other researchers (Burger et al. 2003) have suggested that this population consists of yanacona. However, these other forms of data cannot unequivocally address this question, and Spanish colonial documents suggest more than one social class could have been present at Machu Picchu. The aims of this study are therefore twofold: (1) to isotopically test the hypothesis that these individuals are yanacona, and (2) to formulate a methodological and analytical framework for reconstructing residence/immigration, subsistence and health at Machu Picchu that can be applied to other skeletal populations. To satisfy these aims, I characterized stable (nonradioactive) isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, strontium and lead in preserved tooth enamel and dentine from a large segment of the burial population. In doing so, I was able to profile the diet and region of origin during infancy and childhood from the remains of individuals who died as adults. I also synthesized my own and previously-published data on sex, cemetery context, and pathological conditions of the cranium and dentition. Results show an unprecedented range of variation in the backgrounds of the population: almost all of the individuals in the study population were born elsewhere and immigrated to Machu Picchu after childhood. Moreover, several individuals appeared to have migrated to multiple regions during childhood. They consumed very different diets, which had complex relationships with their estimated region of origin and the prevalence of pathological conditions in their skeletal and dental tissues. Multivariate statistical analyses suggest not only the causal factors involved with certain pathological conditions, but also specific regions from which segments of the population were drawn. Importantly, the distribution of isotopic data for all of the elements studied is wide and stochastic, matching the expected distribution of yanacona. This stands as one of the most complex isotopic and osteological studies in the Andes, and is the first to use biochemical data to assess class- mediated migration. It joins a burgeoning body of research that utilizes biochemical and osteological analyses to paint a more nuanced picture of political economy, subsistence and health in ancient states.","List of Tables and Figures

Assessment of the clinical impact of sequence variants in the
FMR1 gene
By Stephen Charles Collins
Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of developmental
delay, is
typically caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion in FMR1.
However, little is known
about the clinical significance of sequence variants in
FMR1. Only three pathogenic
sequence variants in FMR1 have previously been described:
one missense mutation, one
splice site mutation, and one frameshift nonsense mutation. While
these variants were
detected in patients with classic fragile X-like features, it is
possible that other mutations
may result in a more subtle developmental phenotype. Therefore, to
assess the clinical
impact of FMR1 sequence variants, we performed DNA
sequencing on large populations
of patients with either a fragile X-like phenotype or general
developmental delay.
Through the use of novel high-throughput technologies, namely
array-based sequencing
and massively parallel sequencing, we were able to sequence
FMR1 in significantly more
patients than was previously feasible. Notably, we detected no
pathogenic FMR1
sequence variants in 51 fragile X-like patients. However, in 963
patients with
developmental delay, we detected one missense variant and three
promoter variants, all of
which show evidence of a possible functional effect. If a
functional effect is verified,
these variants would represent the second FMR1 missense
mutation and the first three
FMR1 promoter mutations to cause developmental delay. These
data suggest that
sequence variants in FMR1 may indeed be a significant
contributor to the heterogeneous
etiology of developmental delay.","Table of Contents -- 1.

published,emory:g09vv,"Hammond, Emily Talley",A Choreographic Exploration of Site Context,"Site-specific choreography has been explored throughout
the history of modern dance by many choreographers, including Anna
Halprin, Meredith Monk, and Trisha Brown. By taking dance out of
the studio and off the traditional stage, choreographers find new
opportunities for introducing unique movement ideas into their
dances and invite audiences to view space through an altered point
of view. In my research, I investigate the effect of site context,
or the space in which a piece of choreography is created and
performed, on the process of creation and the overall qualities
that the choreography exudes. As part of this process, I
choreographed a site-specific solo on Emory University's campus and
translated it into the Schwartz dance studio. Conversely, I
commissioned Blake Beckham to set a solo on me in the Schwartz
dance studio, and translated it into the site used for my original
work. The project may be viewed as an abstract version of a
reciprocal transplant experiment, in which the choreography
represents the genetic differences between the two core solos, and
the sites in which each was created may be considered analogous to
the environmental factors. Through this process, the four pieces
have developed unique qualities through the influences of both
spaces, and my intimate understanding of the sites and the
choreography has been enhanced.","I. Introduction 1 -- II. Historical Background and Choreographic

The association between anxiety and nonverbal decoding ability in
children:
Age and gender differences
By Jessica A. Sunshine
The purpose of this study was to examine (1) if an association
exists between the degree of
anxiety in children referred for social problems and the ability to
identify emotions in nonverbal
communication channels and (2) to see if this association differs
by age (5 to 8 years of age; and
9 to 12 years of age) or gender (male and female). Based on the
theorizing of Sullivan (1956),
Harris (1995), and Youniss (1980) who suggested that relationships
were the basis for successful
adjustment, it was predicted that there would be a positive
correlation between nonverbal
receptive skills and the degree of anxiety as observed and rated by
parents. Scores from the
Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy Scale-2 (DANVA2) and the
Child Behavior
Checklist (CBCL) were obtained from the records of children (n =
331) seen at a social skills
training center, Beyond Words. After conducting appropriate
Spearman Correlations, it was
found that gender acted as a moderating variable while age did not.
The association between
anxiety and nonverbal decoding ability varied depending on
children's gender. The more
anxious girls were, the significantly more mistakes they made
identifying emotions in adult faces
and voices than for boys. The findings were discussed within the
framework of the different
ways males and females learn to relate as children.","Table of Contents --

published,emory:13tgn,"Villalobos, Janette Marie","Aerobic, Medal Mediated Ketone Synthesis from Thiol Esters and Boronic Acids","Thiol esters derived from N-substituted and aryl substituted thiosalicylamides were synthesized. Their aerobic coupling with one equivalent of aryl boronic acids
  to give ketones was investigated in the presence of catalytic palladium(0) bis(tricyclohexylphosphine) and copper(I) methyl salicylate. The byproducts of the reaction were found to be mixtures
  S-arylation of the thiosalicylamide pendant and ring closure of the thiosalicylamide to form a benzoisothiazolinone.  A novel, aerobic ketone synthesis from simple
  and complex thiol esters and commercially available boronic acids catalyzed by copper (I) methyl salicylate (CuMeSal) is reported. The reaction is highly chemoselective for thiol esters containing
  an N-tert-butyl or N-iso-propyl -2-mercaptobenzamide pendant. The reaction occurs under very mild reaction conditions (ambient temperature, aerobic,
  neutral conditions, and in the presence of a broad range of functional groups). The application of this chemistry may prove useful for selective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions on complex
  biomolecules. Thiol esters bearing ortho-chelating groups that did not react with copper alone were found to undergo cross-coupling with catalytic amounts of added
  Pd(PCy3)2.  A new ketone synthesis from simple thiol esters and organic halides using copper (I) carboxylates is reported. The reaction
  requires the use of thiol esters containing an N-isopropyl -2-mercaptobenzamide pendant. The reaction occurs under mild reaction conditions (ambient temperature, neutral conditions, under argon). A
  preliminary study of the reaction is presented.","Chapter 1 -- Aerobic Palladium and Copper Catalyzed Coupling of Boronic Acids and Thiol Esters Derived from Thiosalicylamide: Benzoisothiazolinone Formation versus

O6-methyl-dG (MeG) in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Single stranded oligonucleotide
transformation was used to
incorporate one MeG lesion into the yeast genome. By
introducing the lesion into several
different strain backgrounds and examining the sequences after
replication, this study explored
the roles of mismatch repair (MMR), translesion synthesis (TLS),
and template switching in
accurately replicating across the MeG lesion. In
contrast to previous results, this study found
that MMR is crucial to the accurate replication of MeG.
TLS also seems to contribute to the
replication of the MeG lesion, particularly when the
lesion is in the lagging strand. However,
this replication via TLS is typically inaccurate in the absence of
MMR. Finally, this study
discovered that Rad5, which is typically associated with template
switching, plays a significant
role in bypassing the lesion and promoting accurate replication
across the lesion by influencing
other mechanisms, like TLS.","Abstract

published,emory:d74ms,"Acker, Timothy Michael","Structural Determinants of Activity, Mechanism and Structure
Activity Relationships of Novel GluN2C/D Subunit Selective
Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor","The N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ionotropic
glutamate receptors whose family members, identified by sequence
homology and pharmacology, comprise the
2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA),
kainate and delta receptors. The NMDA receptors respond to the
co-agonists glycine and glutamate and mediate the slow component of
excitatory neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system
(CNS). The functional NMDA receptor is a hetero-tetramer consisting
of two GluN1 subunits which bind to glycine and two GluN2 subunits
(GluN2A-D). Both the Glun1 subunits, which have eight different
splice variants, and the GluN2 subunits, which are encoded by four
distinct genes, can impart various unique functional and
pharmacological properties to the functional receptor, with the
GluN2 subunits having a greater impact on the various different
properties. While the receptors have been known and studied
intensely for several decades, until recently, subunit-selective
pharmacological tools remained elusive since the 1980s when the
first selective agent targeting GluN2B receptors was discovered and
characterized. This dissertation describes novel subunit-selective
allosteric modulators which target the GluN2C- and
GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors. The findings include the
identification of key structural determinants of activity for one
of the classes described, the identification of highly potent and
selective congeners within the same class, the stereochemical
preference of one of the more potent and selective members of the
small molecules, the beginning of the physicochemical property
optimization of the molecules and data and hypotheses suggesting
that distinct classes of molecules bind to a shared, or overlapping
site at the GluN2D containing receptors.","-- Chapter 1: Introduction --

Northern Irish Poetry","All the Dead Voices:
Communicating Across the Grave in Contemporary Northern Irish
Poetry
By Michelle R. Miles
""All the Dead Voices"" is an exploration of the various fashions in
which three
contemporary Northern Irish poets-Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley,
and Derek
Mahon-have consulted, ventriloquized, adapted, and ultimately
translated the buried
speech of the dead into living verse. I argue that the vessel of
the ancient Classics has,
like Charon's skiff, ferried these writers to underworld shores and
facilitated their own
creative resurrections alongside those of the shades they
encounter, both during the
period of the Northern Irish Troubles and in its aftermath.
This dissertation interrogates the ethics of translation and argues
that while most critical
response to the work of the three poets has investigated the
relationship between politics
and aesthetics in their verse, less attention has been devoted to
the role that the translation
and adaptation of Greek and Roman Classical texts has played in
their artistic
development, despite the increasing number of such works in their
respective oeuvres.
The cultural, temporal, and linguistic distance of ancient
Mediterranean texts from the
present moment has offered each Northern Irish poet a degree of
aesthetic distance from
historical event, allowing him to approach his ""own dead"" through
the trope of nekuia-
Classical underworld journey. Responding to the political and
aesthetic question of what
it means to bear witness to a traumatic event, this dissertation
argues that the translation
and adaptation of ancient Greek and Roman texts is both the poets'
means of bearing
witness to the deaths of those who have gone before and an
instinctive grappling with the
imperative of their own survival in the aftermath of these
losses.
Finally, I offer a reading of Heaney's, Longley's, and Mahon's use
of lyric poetry (and
occasionally, theatrical dramatization) as means of translating
trauma-experienced,
witnessed, and survived-into bold threads of grief that together,
create a survivors'
tapestry reminding audiences of the capacity of formal poetic
rhythm and structure to
accommodate the most searing measure of human experience-a truth
Classical writers
knew well.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Memento Mori: The Classical

Recommendations","The Southeastern region of the United States, or the ""Deep
South,"" has long been marked by conservative social policies and
resulting poor health indicators. The Deep South has a troubled and
complex history, riddled with racial, gender, and social inequities
that are very much alive today. Women's reproductive lives
represent a particularly charged sociopolitical issue, complicated
by ideas about traditional gender roles, racial prejudices, and
culturally religious morality.
This analysis focuses on reproductive health law and policy of
three neighboring states in the heart of this region: Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama. This study represents a systematic review
of the state codes via the LexisNexis legal database. The goal of
this thesis is to fill the dearth of practical guides to the legal
situation in these states. Those that exist rarely cite to codified
law, and often misinterpret the law. This project also looks into
policies of state agencies, such as health departments, and how
their policies may impact reproductive health. The analysis
includes cultural and historical background, to help advocates
contextualize the origins of these restrictive policies.
The purpose of this thesis is to increase access to reproductive
health and reproductive health services in these three states in
the Deep South, through reducing barriers and promoting positive
reproductive health policies. The hope is that organizations,
health departments, or other advocates will use this guide to
increase access to reproductive and sexual health services in these
states.
Due to entrenched legislative and organizational adversaries, it
is unrealistic to expect the strong tide against reproductive
rights to reverse in any major way. Instead, reproductive justice
advocates can redirect this negative attention to common goals of
health - contraception, safe motherhood, prevention of abortion,
etc., and leverage existing community structures to do so.
Advocates can utilize a multipronged strategy: engage in careful
legislative advocacy, generate a community base of first
responders, focus on moderate policy goals, and implement practical
health interventions under existing law.","Introductionâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦1

The Effects of Deductive and Guided Inductive Approaches on the
Learning of
Grammar in an Advanced College French Course
By Erica K. Dotson
This mixed-methodology investigation evaluated the effects of
deductive and
guided inductive approaches on the learning of targeted linguistic
structures in an
advanced French university grammar course. Specifically this study
compared the effects
of these two pedagogical conditions by measuring students' grammar
performance on
immediate post-treatment tests and pre- and post-tests of
advanced-level grammatical
structures. This project also investigated whether students
preferred to learn via the
guided inductive or deductive approach, and whether there was a
relationship between
their stated instruction delivery preference and their short- and
long-term grammar
performance.
A quasi-experimental equivalent time samples design featuring the
use of pre-,
post- and immediate tests was used to compare students' learning of
10 linguistic
structures in the two conditions. Further, post-test questionnaires
and individual semi-
structured interviews were conducted to gauge participants'
preferences for both
instructional approaches.
Statistical analyses indicated that were no significant differences
detected
between the two conditions with regard to short-term learning of
the targeted grammar
structures. However, this project's findings specifically indicated
that advanced students
made significant gains in grammar performance from pre- to
post-test when they were
first exposed to the grammatical material via the guided inductive
condition. Despite this
result, qualitative findings indicated that participants preferred
to learn deductively. Most
specifically, they indicated that deductive learning was more
comfortable to them as it
was the traditional approach to which they had been exposed
throughout their educational
experiences.

Progesterone in the Treatment of Transient Ischemic Stroke: A
Dose-Response Study
By Justiss A. Kallos

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in America and accounts
for 6% of the total U. S. health care budget. In spite of the
devastating effects stroke exerts on society, only one treatment
has ever been developed that has passed clinical trials: tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA). Unfortunately, tPA use is limited to
less than 5% of stroke victims, leaving 95% without viable
treatment. Studies conducted in numerous neural insult models have
identified progesterone (PROG) as a potent, pleiotropic
neuroprotective steroid. Preliminary studies conducted using PROG
in the treatment of murine ischemic stroke models have demonstrated
that PROG may also be neuroprotective in stroke. The aim of this
study was to determine the best dose of PROG for the treatment of
transient ischemic stroke in middle-aged rats. An intraluminal
filament and suture method was used to induce a transient (2 h)
occlusion in the right middle cerebral artery. Three doses of PROG
were examined: 8 mg/kg, 16 mg/kg, and 32 mg/kg. Treatment was
administered two and six hours post-ischemia, then once daily for
seven consecutive days; the last two doses were tapered in order to
prevent PROG withdrawal syndrome. Cognitive and behavioral outcomes
were evaluated using accelerating rotarod and Morris water maze
paradigms. Twenty-two days post-occlusion, rats were perfused and
infarct volume quantified. Results, in conjunction with previously
reported findings, suggest that 8 mg/kg of PROG is within the ideal
therapeutic range for treating ischemic stroke. Further studies
should confirm these findings in other models of stroke and in
models of populations that are at a higher risk for developing
stroke, such as diabetic and hypertensive populations.","Table of Contents --

Aß multimers
Why don't monkeys get Alzheimer's
disease?
","According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) pathogenesis, the aberrant multimerization of the
ß-amyloid peptide (Aß) is a crucial early event in AD
neurodegeneration and dementia. Aß is a self-aggregating
peptide that accumulates with age in the brains of humans, apes,
and monkeys. However, the full spectrum of AD pathology and
dementia has never been reported in a nonhuman primate. As our
closest living relatives, nonhuman primates are thus unique models
of nonpathologic Aß accumulation. I hypothesized that toxic
Aß aggregates in AD brain are structurally distinct from
Aß multimers formed in nonhuman primate brains. To this end, I
extensively characterized Aß populations in postmortem
cortical samples from AD patients, aged great apes (chimpanzees),
Old World monkeys (rhesus macaques), and New World monkeys
(squirrel monkeys). Using immunohistochemistry, ELISA,
immunoprecipitation/MALDI-TOF MS, Western Blot and in vivo
Aß-seeding assays, I found that cortical Aß populations
are quantitatively and qualitatively similar in AD and aged
nonhuman primates. The major cerebral Aß isoforms (Aß40
and Aß42) accumulate at comparable levels and in similar
ratios in AD and all nonhuman primate groups examined. Furthermore,
post-translationally modified Aß isoforms and low molecular
weight Aß multimers are strikingly similar in AD and aged
nonhuman primate cortical homogenates. I then analyzed higher-order
structural features of AD and nonhuman primate Aß aggregates
using Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB), a radioligand designed for in
vivo PET imaging of ß-amyloid. I confirmed that
3H-PIB binding correlates positively with levels of
insoluble Aß40 and Aß42 in AD cortical homogenates.
However, 3H-PIB binds with very low stoichiometry to
Aß in nonhuman primate cortical homogenates, even in cases
with levels of Aß equal to those in AD. These data suggest
that, despite a common amino acid sequence, cerebral Aß
multimers are structurally distinct in AD and aged nonhuman
primates, and that high-affinity PIB binding may be selective for a
pathogenic molecular conformation of Aß in AD brain. The
identification of structural differences between naturally
occurring, pathogenic and benign Aß multimers could yield
important clues to the uniquely human susceptibility to AD, and
thereby reveal new molecular targets for AD therapeutics.","Contents -- Chapter 1. Introduction and

Huntingtin-Associated Protein 1 (Hap1) is Involved in Insulin
Secretion From
Pancreatic Beta Cells
Hap1 was identified as the first binding partner with huntingtin,
the Huntington disease
(HD) protein. Studies have revealed Hap1 participates in
intracellular trafficking in
neuronal cells, which is adversely affected by the mutant version
of huntingtin (mHtt).
Recently, Hap1 was found in pancreatic beta (β) cells and
other endocrine cells that
secrete hormones via similar exocytic mechanisms. However, the role
of Hap1 in these
endocrine cells is unknown. We generated a mouse model selectively
depleted of Hap1 in
pancreatic β cells using the Cre-loxP genetic manipulation
system. These Hap1 knockout
(KO) mice displayed impairment of glucose tolerance without
affecting insulin
sensitivity. We validated that decreased Hap1, via its shRNA,
reduced glucose-stimulated
insulin release in Min6 cells, a well-studied pancreatic β
cell line. In addition, ELISA
measurement of insulin levels in blood confirmed Hap1 KO mice are
defective for insulin
release in response to glucose treatment. Electron microscopy
revealed decreased
numbers of insulin-containing vesicles at the docking sites in
β cell membranes of Hap1
KO mice. Glucose-stimulated insulin release also reduced the
phosphorylation of
pHap1A in both cell and mouse models. Moreover, this
glucose-induced
dephosphorylation caused more Hap1 to associate with kinesin light
chain and dynactin
p150, both of which are involved in microtubule-dependent
trafficking. These results
suggest Hap1-associated intracellular trafficking is important for
vesicular release of
insulin from pancreatic β cells, providing a potential target
for treating the impairment of
β cell insulin release seen in HD and other metabolic
disorders.

Three Essays in Environmental and Resource Economics
This dissertation studies three important and timely topics related
to the use of
natural resources and the generation of pollutants. Chapter One
explores the impact
that state water management frameworks have on farm productivity.
Prior
appropriation law states allow greater access to surface waters for
use in irrigation, a
critical input for crops. I find that states operating under this
form of water law have
corn yields that are approximately 20 to 30 bushels per acre higher
than their riparian
law counterparts. This represents an 18 to 28% increase on average.
Chapter Two
addresses to what extent oil producers respond to changes in price
and whether higher
royalties on oil production result in a reduction in the life of a
producing lease. By
exploiting a unique lease-level data set of monthly sales of oil
from leases on federal
properties, I estimate that production from the vast majority of
currently producing
leases is highly inelastic. Estimated elasticities are small and
generally not significantly
different than zero. This data set also includes data from the
fourteen-year period during
which marginal leases were granted royalty reductions by the Bureau
of Land
Management to stimulate production during periods of low price. The
most marginal of
this class of leases, those that do not report sales regularly,
have significantly higher
elasticities. Further, leases that participated in the royalty
reduction program had a 15%
lower probability of being shut-in than those leases that were not
eligible for the
program. Finally, Chapter Three investigates a novel method to
predict carbon dioxide
emissions from developing countries, the primary driver of
emissions growth over the past
decade. I employ an environmental Kuznets curve-type analysis to
predict emissions, but
rather than relating the level of per capita pollutant to a
country's gross domestic
product, I use a socio-economic status measure constructed from
household
characteristics and possessions survey data from developing
countries. This approach
improves on in-sample prediction of emissions which rely on gross
domestic product
alone, although data limitations prevent formal testing of this
conclusion.",

Amygdala: Gene Expression, HPA Axis Function, and Behavior","Abstract
Mood and anxiety disorders including major depressive disorder
and post-traumatic stress
disorder have been associated with a disrupted
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
response to stress, attributed to corticotropin-releasing factor
(CRF) overexpression in the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). However, PVN
output is determined by
summation of signals from limbic and brainstem sources; disruption
in one of these regions may
result in increased PVN CRF and thus HPA axis hyperactivity.
Long-term gene expression
changes which confer the chronic nature of these disorders may take
place primarily in the PVN
or may take place primarily in limbic structures, which then
modulate the PVN. The utility of
CRFergic circuits as pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of
mood and anxiety disorders could
be improved with greater knowledge of distinct, regionally-specific
CRF expression patterns.
The goal of this research is to develop tools to manipulate gene
expression within CRF-producing
cells. Here we describe a transgenic mouse in which 3.0Kb of the
CRF promoter reliably targets
transgene expression to CRF-producing neurons. The cell-type
specificity of this promoter was
also employed in a lentiviral vector to overexpress CRF from
CRFergic cells. Because the CeA
is known to influence the behavioral stress-response and
hypothesized to play a role in HPA axis
regulation, this virus was injected bilaterally into the CeA of
adult male rats. Chronic CRF
overexpression in the CeA increased expression of CRF and
vasopressin in the PVN, leading to
increased HPA axis activation, and decreased expression of MR in
the hippocampus, resulting in
HPA axis disinhibition. These gene-expression changes and HPA axis
hyperactivity also resulted
in an increase in anxiety-like behavior. These data suggest that
HPA axis hyperactivity in human
patients may be secondary to altered signals from CRF neurons
within the CeA. This and future
work elucidating the precise mechanisms through which
overexpression of CRF precipitates
psychopathology may provide useful preventative and therapeutic
tools for mood and anxiety
disorders.","-- Chapter 1: General Introduction and Background -- Page

Wars","This paper examines how the United States Forest Service
grew and strengthened its position within the American bureaucracy
in the first half of the twentieth century. After being founded in
1905 the agency underwent a period of consistent growth derived not
only from its work maintaining the system of National Forests, but
also from its participation in two special projects designed to aid
the American effort in each of the two World Wars. In the First
World War the Forest Service assembled a regiment of foresters and
lumbermen, the 20th Engineers (Forestry) Regiment, that
went to France and produced from the French forests the wood
products necessary for use by the American troops. During the
Second World War the bureau was responsible for the facilitation of
the Emergency Rubber Project in Salinas, California; this measure
was implemented in March 1942 with the goal of producing a domestic
supply of natural rubber derived from the guayule shrub. These two
efforts resulted in opposing outcomes: the Twentieth Engineers were
successful in rapidly producing ample wood for use by the American
Army in France, while the Emergency Rubber Project and its guayule
crop were ultimately liquidated after having been overshadowed by
the explosive emergence of synthetic rubber. Both projects came as
a result of abnormal wartime circumstances and allowed the Forest
Service the opportunity to use its expertise in order to contribute
to the national war effort. While completing both projects the
agency attracted attention from the federal government and from the
public, and its response in these times of crisis helped it prove
its importance to itself, to the federal government, and to the
nation.","Introduction: The Forest Service in the American

African Americans","Research has found that approximately half of African Americans
show positive implicit in-group (black) preferences and the other
half show positive out-group (white) preferences. This study
attempts to clarify the factors that are associated with lower
in-group positivity among this population than has been documented
in European Americans. Explicit and implicit preferences and
identity were examined among African American children and young
adults. Several potential contributing factors were examined: how
strongly individuals identify with their racial group, the impact
of racial socialization (parental racial attitudes/behaviors), race
composition of school, and socio-economic status. The sample
included 216 participants between ages 5-23 (M=15.37, SD =5.73).
The sample was separated into two groups, the younger cohort
(M=9.09, SD=3.05) and the college student cohort (M=19.85, SD=
1.12). Out of all participants in the younger cohort, 53% attended
homogeneous/predominantly black schools. In the college student
cohort 42% of the participants attended a racially
homogeneous/predominantly black college. The remainder of the
college participants attended a racially heterogeneous school.
Results showed a lack of an implicit in-group/black preference in
the younger cohort confirming our hypothesis and consistent with
previous research (Baron &amp; Banaji, 2009; Newheiser &amp; Olson,
2012). This study contradicts previous findings of a lack of an
implicit in-group bias in an older sample of African Americans
(Nosek, Banaji, &amp; Greenwald, 2002; Livingston, 2002;
Ashburn-Nardo, Knowles, &amp; Monteith, 2003; Richeson, Trawalter,
&amp; Shelton, 2005), as we provide evidence of an implicit
preference in favor of their in-group in the college sample. In
terms of implicit identity, both children and adults more readily
associated black faces with words about the self than white faces.
In general, the African Americans in this study held an explicit,
pro-black preference and identity that showed positive associations
with age. This study provided evidence of correlations between
explicit and implicit measures; it also suggested that above and
beyond the racial composition of schools, African Americans' racial
preferences and identity can be predicted by the specific types of
racial socialization messages they have received about racism and
about the social status of their in-group.","Table of Contents -- Introduction to the

associations with pediatric asthma in a time-series framework","Every time we take a breath outside we inhale a mixture of
different pollutants; however, examining the associations between
these pollutant mixtures and health endpoints is challenging. This
dissertation uses different methodological approaches to understand
the associations between air pollution mixtures and emergency
department visits for pediatric asthma. Time series with daily
counts of emergency department visits for any diagnosis of asthma
or wheeze among pediatric patients were obtained from hospitals in
metropolitan Atlanta (1999-2010), Dallas (2006-09) and St. Louis
(2001-07). Daily measurements of ambient concentrations of ozone,
carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter &lt;2.5
microns in diameter (PM2.5) were obtained
from monitors in all three metropolitan areas. In addition, daily
estimates of PM2.5 source concentrations
were made available for Atlanta using a Bayesian-based ensemble
source apportionment technique.
A modified classification and regression tree algorithm
was developed to enable the identification of multipollutant joint
effects. This algorithm was then used to determine the
multipollutant joint effects associated with pediatric asthma in
Atlanta, as well as the common multipollutant joint effects
identified in Atlanta, Dallas and St. Louis. These analyses found
certain types of days, characterized by their multipollutant
profiles, to be associated with a statistically significant
increase in asthma emergency department
visits.PM2.5 appeared to be one of the
pollutants driving the formation of these harmful day types and
thus further analyses were conducted to determine the associations
between pediatric asthma and PM2.5 sources.
A positive association was observed for the cumulative, seven-day
effect a 1 microgram increase in biomass burnings (rate ratio:
1.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.03), diesel vehicle
emissions (rate ratio: 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.08),
and gasoline vehicle emissions (rate ratio: 1.07, 95% confidence
interval: 1.03, 1.11). These confidence intervals account for
uncertainties in the source apportionment estimates using multiple
imputation methods.
This dissertation makes methodological contributions to
the field of epidemiology with the development of a classification
and regression algorithm that is well-suited for identifying joint
effects of exposure mixtures. It also adds to the growing body of
literature which suggests a harmful effect of multipollutant
exposures on pediatric asthma.","Chapter 1: Introduction 1 --

infestation within a tropical urban environment","Background:Dengue, the most important mosquito
borne viral disease in the world, is a major source of morbidity
and mortality in tropical and temperate urban environments. While
spatial clustering of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti
has been previously studied, long term trends in clustering
have not. This represents a promising area of study to help
effectively target vector control in areas with limited
resources.
Objective:This study longitudinally quantified the long
term (over 3 years) spatial trends of Aedes aegypti clustering in
the Maynas neighborhood of Iquitos, a city in the Peruvian Amazon,
and determined the factors that influence a home's membership in a
cluster of high mosquito abundance.
Methods:Spatial methods at the global (neighborhood) and
local (household) level were applied to understand long term trends
in adult and pupae clustering from 9 entomologic surveys spaced ~4
months. A GLM model was used to determine which household and
environmental characteristics predicted proportion of time a
household was a member of a cluster.
Results:While individual analysis of entomologic surveys
did not indicate the occurrence of any apparent clustering, the
proportion of time house was a cluster for adults as well as the
proportion of time a house was a cluster for pupae ranged from 0-1,
with some houses being members of clusters a high proportion of the
time. Average kernel density across survey also showed a clear long
term pattern of clustering. The best model predicting proportion of
time house was a member of a cluster used household
characteristics.
Discussion:Although Ae aegypti is highly
heterogeneous and poorly predicted, overall there is a strong
distribution pattern, Results from the model indicate household
characteristics like water source and number of residents are good
predictors of cluster membership. Future research should connect
information on clusters to dengue infection, to determine if living
in, or visiting a cluster raises risk of infection with dengue.","Abstract.............................................. iv --

Is parental sugar sweetened beverage consumption a risk factor
for children's sugar sweetened beverage consumption?","Background: Rising rates of obesity,
risk factors for diabetes, and other chronic diseases in children
have been linked to energy imbalance and sugar sweetened beverage
(SSB) overconsumption. Access to SSBs, parenting style, and
parental modeling may play a strong role in influencing child SSB
consumption.
Methods: A sample of 1,139
parent/child dyads from throughout the U.S. was examined to test
the association of parents' and children's SSB intake. The
relationship between parent and child consumption was examined in
bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models.
Results: This study finds
a statistically significant association between parent and
child SSB consumption. An unadjusted odds ratio shows that
the odds of a child consuming SSBs daily are 2.01 times
higher in children that have parents who are themselves daily SSB
consumers. This relationship is reduced to an odds ratio of
1.89 when demographic variables and potential interactions are
introduced into the analysis, and race/ethnicity proves to be an
effect modifier in the relationship between parent and child SSB
consumption.
Conclusion: Results suggest that
parent SSB consumption is associated with child SSB consumption;
however this association was statistically significant only in
white parent/child dyads. This association between parent and child
SSB consumption can influence public health practices and
initiatives aimed at curbing childhood obesity and chronic disease
by encouraging policy makers and public health professionals to
make parents the focus of interventions.","1. INTRODUCTION

kinase CK1","Regulation of ciliary dynein by the axonemal protein kinase
CK1

By Avanti Gokhale


Cilia are highly conserved organelles that play essential motile
and sensory roles
required for normal development and function of most organs in the
adult. The goal of
my work is to study mechanisms that regulate dynein motor activity
and control
ciliary/flagellar motility. Genetic and functional studies revealed
ciliary dynein is
regulated by phosphorylation, and that a CK1-like kinase is located
in the axoneme and
thought to phosphorylate the intermediate chain IC138 of the inner
dynein arm isoform
I1. I postulated that CK1 is targeted and anchored on the outer
doublet microtubules, near
I1 dynein, to regulate dynein-driven microtubule sliding and
control ciliary movement.
To test this, I cloned and characterized the axonemal CK1 in
Chlamydomonas, and
confirmed it is a highly conserved member of the CK1 family of
kinases. Analysis of
ciliary structural mutants and immunofluorescence analysis revealed
that CK1 is
anchored on the outer doublet microtubules, along the entire length
of the axonemes.
Consistent with this localization, chemical crosslinking in
axonemes revealed that CK1
directly interacts with tubulin.
To study the physiologocial role of axonemal CK1, I took advantage
of an in vitro
microtubule sliding assay to measure dynein activity in mutant
axonemes lacking the
radial spoke structures ( pf17). Importantly, in absence of
the radial spokes, axonemal
CK1 activity is misregulated resulting in global inhibition of
dynein-driven microtubule
sliding. Consistent with this conclusion, CK1 inhibitors rescued
dynein activity in pf17 axonemes. Using a novel
approach, to produce CK1-depleted axonemes, I tested the idea
that removal of CK1 would restore dynein activity. As predicted,
CK1 depletion restored
dynein-driven microtubule sliding, mimicking the effect of CK1
inhibitors. Using a
purified, recombinant CK1, I reconstituted the CK1-depleted
pf17 axonemes and restored
inhibition of dynein activity, in a CK1 kinase-inhibitor sensitive
manner. Furthermore,
reconstitution of CK1-depleted axonemes with a purified,
recombinant ""kinase-dead""
CK1 did not restore the inhibition of dynein activity. These
results demonstrated that
CK1 kinase activity is required for regulation of dynein-driven
microtubule sliding.
This work addresses fundamental aspects of signal transduction and
regulation of
dynein motors in cilia. The data are consistent with the model that
CK1 is a structural
component of the axoneme, localized on the outer doublet
microtubules in position to
regulate phosphorylation of IC138 and control microtubule sliding.
Additional
challenges include identifying the precise location of CK1 in the
axoneme and identifying
interacting proteins that anchor and localize CK1. One prediction
is that CK1 is located
adjacent to I1 dynein, anchored by a novel class of CK1-anchoring
proteins (CKAPs).
Further tests also include identification of key phosphorylated
residues in IC138 to
directly test how IC138 contributes to regulation of dynein
activity and ciliary motility.","Table of contents: -- Chapter 1: Introduction 1 -- I.

High Resolution X Chromosome Copy Number Variation in Autism
The autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a broadly defined set of
developmental
disorders that include autism and Asperger syndrome. Individuals
with ASD are defined
as having impairments in social interaction, deficiencies in
communication, as well as
restricted and stereotyped behaviors and interests. Leo Kanner
first described autism in
1943, and subsequent twin and family studies have demonstrated a
substantial genetic
component underlying ASD. A marked increase in the prevalence of
ASD has been noted
in the last decade, and the most recent estimate suggests a
prevalence of 1:88. A four- to
ten-fold male preponderance of ASD suggests the existence of
sex-specific risk alleles
and the possibility of a recessive susceptibility locus on the
X-chromosome. In the last
eight years, copy number variation (CNV) has been appreciated as a
rich source of both
inherited and de novo human genomic variation.
Technological advances in array Comparative Genomic Hybridization
(aCGH), the
common microarray based assay used to assess copy number state,
have enabled
detection of increasingly smaller variants. We developed a custom
high-density array
consisting of 2.1 million oligonucleotide probes dedicated to the
X-chromosome. Non-
repetitive sequence is probed at a resolution of one probe per 50
bp or 96.8 megabases of
unique sequence. Additionally, we further enhanced the stringency
and thus rigor with
which samples are interrogated by developing a hybridization and
wash protocol for the
Tecan HSPro 4800. The application of this machine standardized
hybridization, wash,
and dry conditions across all samples.
Using our custom X-chromosome CGH microarrays, we screened three
cohorts for X-
chromosome CNV. The first cohort was a series of 100 ASD males from
the Autism
Genetic Resource Exchange collection. Our second cohort of 64 ASD
males was derived
from the Simons Simplex Collection. Finally, our third cohort
consisted of 100 males
from a National Institute of Mental Health control population where
individuals were
selected as controls for the study of neuropsychiatric disease. In
total, 164 ASD males
and 100 non-ASD males were evaluated for X-chromosome CNV.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT -- APPROVAL SHEET --

published,emory:brcs5,"Embry, Venita Von'Ta","'Maybe it'll take my mind off the situation': Stressors, coping,
and social support for African‐American women with
incarcerated partners","Disparate arrest and sentencing practices have created an era of
mass incarceration,
particularly for African-American men. This mass incarceration
reverberates through
communities: at arrest, approximately 50% of men are in a committed
heterosexual
relationship. Thus, it is important to identify mass
incarceration's indirect effects. This analysis
sought to identify unique emotional stressors, coping strategies,
and support sources for
African-American women with incarcerated partners.

African-American women (N=31) with recently incarcerated male
partners were
recruited into this longitudinal qualitative study. Twenty
participants were alcohol or drug
misusers (AOD). Each participant took part in four one-on-one
semi-structured interviews over a
year; the first two waves of data were analyzed here. Grounded
theory was used for analysis. In
addition, the study examined differences between AOD and non-AOD
participants. Lazarus and
Folkman's Theory of Stress and the concept of resilience were used
to provide a theoretical
framework.

Findings suggest many women experienced emotional stressors such as
loss of intimacy
with partner, increased parenting responsibilities, and conflict
with others. However, women
who were financially dependent on the male partner
pre-incarceration experienced greater
difficulty adjusting to the incarceration. These women also
encountered stress related to
financial hardships such as being financially dependent on others
and guilt at not being able to
provide for herself, her children, and her incarcerated partner.
Most AOD participants were
financially dependent on their partner pre-incarceration and more
commonly experienced
housing instability and domestic abuse throughout the relationship.
However, AOD women may
have seen their partner's incarceration as an opportunity to make
significant life changes.

Social withdrawal and internal coping strategies (e.g. substance
use, praying, etc.) were
used most often immediately following incarceration. Over time, the
women began engaging in
social interaction (external coping strategies) for support. Fear
of incarcerated-related stigma
was a strong factor for many women in deciding to seek social
support. Future research on this
population needs to be conducted to provide a deeper understanding
of the processes and
effects of these stressors and coping strategies. In addition, more
widespread and detailed
resources relating to correctional policies and sources for
financial and emotional assistance are
needed for these women.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Introduction

the conditions under which interpersonal identification arises and
dissipates for individual members of collectives. To these ends I
examine dialectics as a method of doing social theory, articulate
the unique structures of agency appropriate to various collective
entities like families, economies and political states, and defend
a theory of joint authorship to account for the solidarity of group
beliefs. With this support I present a project-based understanding
of collective action that demonstrates the transformation of
projects from serial collectives to fused groups to institutions. I
situate this Sartrean theory within Hegel's and Marx's independent
philosophies on collective action, Sartre's early attempts at
addressing the topic, and Margaret Gilbert's contemporary theory of
joint commitment and joint action.","-- Introduction: 1 -- Questions of Dialectic and Method: The

'I dared to tell': Young Paraguayan men's navigation of
contrasting
normative masculinities and their romantic
relationships
By Paul J. Fleming
Background: As emerging adults, adolescents try to create
their gender identity for their peers and
community. Romantic and sexual relationships are a way that young
men can define
themselves and their masculine identity. However, young men's
resulting sexual decisions
can affect their successful transition into the man they want to
be, as wel as STI and HIV
rates, and rates of adolescent pregnancies. Peer groups and
families play a big role in
shaping young men's perceptions of normative behavior. Men can use
their health-related
behaviors to construct their masculinity. Behaviors that can be
negative for young men's
health actually can be normative and help improve their social
status and negotiation of
power.
Methods: In the Bañado Sur neighborhood in Asuncion,
Paraguay, five focus groups were
conducted with young male peer groups ranging in age from 14 to 19.
The peer groups were
asked about normative behaviors for young men in their neighborhood
and about romantic
and sexual relationship dynamics. Half the members from each peer
group were selected to
participate in individual interviews that examined the same topics
but from an individual
perspective. The qualitative data were analyzed to understand
dynamics between
relationship behaviors and masculine identity for young men in the
neighborhood.
Results: Two different types of masculine norms were
described ('provider' and 'macho man') as
wel as two different types of romantic relationships ('casual' and
'formal'). The language
used to describe each spectrum of behaviors was very similar and
represented the
connection between masculine norms and romantic relationships. In
addition, the perceived
norms for the neighborhood were much more 'macho man' than the
reported behaviors of
the young men.
Conclusions: Perceived norms cannot change unless young men
are wil ing to speak out about
their 'non-normative' behaviors. Because of the risk for teasing,
few young men are wil ing
to do this. This provides an evidence base for need more
information on actual attitudes
and behaviors of young men (compared to the prevailing thought
about those attitudes and
behaviors). In addition, interventions should give young men a
space to speak out about
'non-normative' behaviors in order to begin changing
norms.

Literature, and Photography of Fatema Mernissi, Leïla Sebbar,
and Lalla Essaydi","This dissertation examines the scholarship, literature, and
photography of scholar Fatema Mernissi, writer Leïla Sebbar,
and photographer Lalla Essaydi. As women born in North Africa,
these artists risk being subsumed in a female ""eastern"" or ""Arab""
identity, in which gender and birthplace are understood as the
dominant categories through which their works are studied. However,
their lived experiences, as reflected in their art, go beyond the
binaries produced by these classifications and extend to
pluralistic positionalities including, but not limited to,
nationality, education, ethnicity, class, race, gender, sexuality,
and linguistic and cultural influences. While these intersecting
categories are crucial to my work, I seek to push them a step
further to see how Mernissi, Sebbar, and Essaydi express these
various positionalities through multiple and intersecting textual,
visual, and embodied mediums. In Chapter One, through a study of
three central tropes in Essaydi's Converging
Territories-veiling, writing, and space-I identify Essaydi's
""converging territories"" in order to examine the artist's practice
of interweaving mediums and establish it as essential to her
process of creation as well as to her position as artist. Chapter
Two focuses on Sebbar's historical novel La Seine était
rouge. In recreating a history for October 17, 1961, I contend
that Sebbar forms a multimedia methodology that not only
recuperates memories of the events of the Paris Massacre, but also
presents a means by which to reclaim historical events more
generally. In the third chapter, I engage with the Chicana feminist
Gloria Anzaldúa's notion of the ""frontera"" as a
framework through which I consider representations of the harem put
forth in Mernissi's Dreams of Trespass and Essaydi's
collection Harem. I argue that Mernissi and Essaydi
dismantle the historical, cultural, and gendered borders of the
harem-a female Moroccan frontera-and re-appropriate it as a
critical and collective feminine space of artistic production.
Finally, I propose that Mernissi, Sebbar, and Essaydi's
tissage-a combining of mediums-provides an innovative model
for intellectual production that encourages academics to
participate in creative and multimedia practices in order to
reimagine the possibilities for our own scholarship.",

with Lupus Through the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program","Purpose: Lupus, as a chronic disease with
heterogeneous phenotypes of varying disease severity, has led to a
higher burden of disease associated with women of color. Low cost
high-impact interventions that inform and encourage effective
disease self-management are needed. The Chronic Disease
Self-Management Program (CDSMP), as a low cost evidence-based
intervention, is beneficial and acceptable to the socioeconomically
disadvantaged targeted cohort of African American (AA) women with
lupus in this study. This program is designed to improve
self-management skills and enhance social relationships. This study
seeks to understand the social support needs of AA women with lupus
and the ways in which the CDSMP addresses these needs. The
theoretical perspectives hypothesize that social relationships
contribute to overall health.
Methods: Participants were recruited from a public
hospital's lupus clinic. A triangulation approach was utilized with
qualitative data from forty-five participants who completed the
CDSMP, and the two CDSMP leaders. Data was collected from focus
groups, questionnaires, and semi-structured leader interviews.
Data Analysis: Focus group transcripts were analyzed
using thematic analysis. A thematic code dictionary was developed,
informed by the qualitative data and the study's theoretical
perspectives, including Cohen's definitions of social relationships
and resources. Focus group data were analyzed utilizing ATLAS.ti
and SPSS. Other data were clustered based on social support
relevance defined by the code dictionary.
Results: Six key social support themes emerged that
depicted the emotion- and problem-focused supportive channels of
the CDSMP. The program promoted healthy behaviors directly and
indirectly addressing issues leading to more productive and
rewarding social interactions. Participants reported feeling
empowered to be more proactive in their medical care. The avoidance
and reduction of stress effects were indicated as major components
for active self-care, referred to as ""self-love"" by the
participants.
Summary: This qualitative study provided a greater
understanding of the role of social support in this cohort of AA
women with lupus. The person-environment relationships were shown
to have a significant role in the ability to cope with stress and
self-manage their chronic disease. The CDSMP offered the
psychological resources to enhance resilience and coping
capacities, healthy behaviors, and overall well-being.","Chapter 1: Introduction -- Chapter 2: Review of Literature --

Stress, Cortisol, and Externalizing Behavior in Adolescent Males:
An Examination in the
Context of Multisystemic Therapy
By Julia C. Schechter
Aggression and delinquency are associated with an array of
emotional, behavioral, and
health problems (Loeber, Burke, Lahey, Winters, &amp; Zera, 2000).
Additionally, a
multitude of variables are thought to lead to the development of
externalizing disorders in
adolescent males. The purpose of the current study was to
investigate the relationship
among stress, cortisol, and externalizing behaviors in males,
specifically in a treatment
context. In an effort to examine potential differential effects of
stressor types, measures
of stress were delineated into lifetime, current episodic, and
daily hassles sub-categories.
This study examined data from a sample of 120 adolescent males
(mean age = 15 years)
referred to Multisystemic Therapy (MST) for externalizing problems.
Partial correlations
were used to examine concurrent relationships among self-reported
stress, morning
cortisol, and externalizing problems (parent reports of aggression
and delinquency) at
time of referral. Analyses did not yield significant relationships
between stress or cortisol
and externalizing behavior prior to treatment. Regression analyses
were used to measure
whether cortisol or stress predicted treatment outcome for youths
with externalizing
behavior problems. Results indicated that compared to youth who had
experienced fewer
hassles, youth that had experienced more daily hassles had higher
levels of externalizing
behavior after treatment. This relationship was moderated by
cortisol levels at
awakening, such that youth with more daily hassles and high levels
of cortisol had the
worst outcome at post treatment. This interaction remained
significant after controlling
for post treatment internalizing disorders. Implications and future
directions for treatment
are discussed.

Ethnicity in Rural Guatemala","The following literature review and qualitative study
discusses the factors, both historic and present contributing to
the unequal access to adequate health care experienced by
indigenous Guatemalans in comparison to their ladino
counterparts (Guatemalans of European descent). The principal
investigator performed an extensive and systematic review of
literature relating to Guatemalan history, human rights, the right
to health, and indigenous rights. They then conducted in-depth
interviews (IDIs) with key informants in-country in the towns of
San Juan La Laguna and San Pablo La Laguna, SololÃ¡,
Guatemala in order to gain a more contextual, field-based
perspective on the issues. These data were analyzed
using the ICESCR General Comment 14's AAAQ Framework for health
facilities, goods and services, as well as other international
right to health legislation. The investigator found that the main
factors contributing to unequal access were systematic and historic
discrimination against indigenous Guatemalans, lower socioeconomic
status, poor representation in political spheres of their health
needs, cultural differences between ethnicities, and the
concentration of health services in areas where primarily
ladino Guatemalans reside. To address
these deep-seated issues and improve the unequal burden of disease
experienced by these populations, it is necessary to develop and
implement a National Plan of Action for Guatemala that upholds the
AAAQ Framework as its main objective as well as the right to health
for those indigenous communities.","--

Records were de-duplicated and linked using a unique identifier,
which included sex, date of birth, and portions of first and last
names. The analysis dataset included injury records for the first
emergency room encounter per child over the three-year period. The
data was restricted to children age 0-3. Of 42,539 records for
children age 0-3 presenting with an injury diagnosis from
2008-2010, 32,927 (77%) linked to a Georgia Birth Record in 2007. A
total of 8,451 children had multiple emergency room discharge
records. The risk of unintentional injury requiring emergency room
or hospital care was 21.4%. Males had 19% higher risk of injury
than did females of the same age (95%CI: 1.17, 1.21, p&lt;0.0001).
Open wound of head, neck, and trunk was most common injury category
(n=7,122, 21.6%) for this age group. Maternal age at birth was the
strongest independent risk factor for childhood unintentional
injury before the age of four. Risk of childhood injury decreased
with increasing maternal age (CMH=198.6, p&lt;0.0001). After
adjusting for offspring sex, maternal educational level, and
maternal first birth event, children born to mothers age 15 to 19
were 1.59 times more likely to present with an injury at an
emergency room or hospital than children born to mothers age 25 to
29 (95%CI: 1.54, 1.64). This study adds to the growing body of
literature employing childhood record linkage and argues for more
focused research of childhood injury.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- BACKGROUND / LITERATURE
