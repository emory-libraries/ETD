Effects of supervisor support and work environment
characteristics on using time at work to exercise in a worksite
randomized controlled trial of physical activity
By Jeffrey Michael Bale
Objective: To examine the association between perceived
work environment supports, including supervisor support, and using
time at work to exercise.
Methods: Utilizing data from the Physical Activity and
Life Styles (PALS) randomized control trial of 188 participants who
were provided time at work to exercise, time at work to exercise
was modeled with multivariate logistic regression adjusting for
covariates and the effects of department-level clustering.
Supervisor surveys and focus groups were analyzed to determine the
level of supervisor support.
Results: Participants who indicated that they were able
to take off work to exercise were 2.8 times more likely to use time
at work to exercise that those who were not able to take off work
to exercise (95% CI 1.3 to 6.1); Participants who had too much work
to get everything done well were 0.3 times less likely to use time
at work to exercise (95% CI, 0.2 to 0.7); Participants who had
enough time to get everything done well were 3.7 times as likely to
use time at work to exercise (95% CI 1.6 to 8.5). Job satisfaction
and the ability to take time off for personal matters were not
significantly associated with using time. Participants who did not
use the intervention cited lack of supervisor support as a reason
for not using time.
Conclusions: The results support the hypothesis that
individuals with a supportive work environment were more likely to
use time at work to exercise. Not all work environment
characteristics were significant, suggesting that workload and
having time during the day are more important than job satisfaction
or the ability to start or quit at varying times. Supervisor
support affected whether participants used time at work to
exercise, suggesting that supervisors have a role in enabling
employees to participate in physical activity.
Keywords: supervisor support, work environment, physical
activity, time at work to exercise, time at work for physical
activity.","Table of Contents -- Literature

Women in Urban North India","Why is it so hard for us to do what is best for our health, and
why do we often feel compelled to do things that are harmful for
our bodies? The research described in this dissertation sought to
respond to this persistent human problem by exploring health
choices among a group of people with magnified self-care needs:
women with type 2 diabetes in New Delhi, India. The general theme
of the research was how type 2 diabetic women balance their mental
health, social health, and physical health in this rapidly
developing part of the world.
Between 2009 and 2011, the research engaged over 400 diabetic
and non-diabetic women recruited from public, private, and
charitable clinics in New Delhi. Using mixed methods, it
investigated women's perceptions of appropriate gendered social
roles, their ability or disability to participate in these roles,
their mental health status using both locally derived and standard
screeners, health management choices, and actual physical health
outcomes (measured using anthropometrics and blood biomarkers).
The research found that women experience significant
psychosocial and practical conflicts living with diabetes, an
illness requiring a great deal of self-care, in a cultural context
where gender roles strongly emphasize women's service
to others. This tension can be conceptualized as a choice between
self-care for the sake of one's physical health and other-care for
the sake of one's social health (and, of course, for others'
benefit). In this calculus, the care of others usually wins out.
The vast majority of women in my study do not attain good diabetes
control, but do report good mental health, unlike many people with
diabetes in other parts of the world. I suggest that this anomalous
result is partially due to the possibility that by choosing the
care of others over self-care, women preserve a crucial ability to
participate in social roles that shape their identities and confer
social status. This, however, comes at the expense of their
physical health, and as such I emphasize the centrality of women's
service-oriented gendered roles in shaping their health choices. I
consider the theoretical implications of this scenario for
anthropology, and also address the practical implications of these
findings for diabetic women's health. The dissertation concludes
with recommendations for practitioners engaged in global health
policy and programming about culturally viable ways to improve
women's adherence to self-care regimens for diabetes and other
chronic illnesses.

Identification of the Effect of Population Stratification on
Association Studies of Rare
Variants

BY Yunxuan Jiang
Human genome research, which aims to find the genetic etiology
of the disease, is having a more
and more profound influence on public health. And rare variants,
which both have large effect
size and can explain a great proportion of heritability, are
becoming the focus of current human
genome research. Although several statistical methods have
developed to increase the power of
detecting rare variants and reduce false positive rate, none of
these methods address an important
issue that often arises in genetic studies: false positives due to
population stratification.
Population stratification is a well-known problem that can
substantially cause inflated false
positive rate and decreased power to detect real association. We
simulated several case-control
studies with different sample size and population structure
according to a series of disease
prevalence for each population (Europea and Africa), and found that
population stratification can
have a significant influence on rare variants studies. The false
positive rate increases dramatically
as sample size increase and population structure become extreme. We
applied principal
component analysis to control for population structure. Our results
showed that the principal
component method performed very well even for highly structured
data. The false positive rate
remained around 0.05 in our simulation. Our results implicates that
researchers need to carefully
match case and control ancestry, in order of avoid false positive
caused by population structure in
rare variants study. If it is inevitable to recruit samples from
different population, then researchers
can correct for it with our easy implemented method.

Role in the Hero's Journey","The Middle English Breton lais famously boast an array of
characters who later stoked the fantastical imaginations with their
depictions of Otherworld figures such as supernatural villains,
allies and lovers. My thesis examines the role of these Otherworld
characters and evaluates their relationship with the main character
in terms of the main character's spiritual and psychological
transformation. Ultimately, I am examining why these Breton lais
written around the 14th century necessitate the presence
of the Otherworld figures. My research spans across three prominent
Breton lais: Sir Orfeo, Sir Launfal and
Guingamor. Each of these lais has an important supernatural
character who establishes a change of fate for the protagonist.
Among the topics my research addresses are the depiction of fairy
motifs (such as grafted trees, portals into the Otherworld and
depictions of fairies), the gender disparity between two characters
(in the lais of Sir Launfal and Guingamor, the
Otherworldly character evolves into a romantic interest) and
finally the psychological suggestions embedded in the lai that
depict the main character in all of his complexity. In order to
achieve this, I contrast each lai with what I believe is its Celtic
and Classical source story to deduce what was left out, and why,
and how these additions or subtractions from the ""original"" story
inform our understanding of the Otherworld.","Table of Contents -- Ch.1 Sir Orfeo: A Tale of Spiritual
