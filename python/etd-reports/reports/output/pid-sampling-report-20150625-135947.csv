Bipolar-like and Depression-like Symptoms","The chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm often uses preference for
sucrose as a measure of
hypothesized anhedonia in rats. However, this measure is rife with
unreliability, an issue that
could be due to genetic differences between rats. This study tested
this hypothesis by subjecting
rats selectively bred for affective disorder-like behavior to CMS.
Five lines of rats selectively-
bred for behavior related to affective disorders were used:
Hyperactive (HYPER), Swim-test
Susceptible (SUS), Swim-test Resistant (RES), Swim Low-active
(SwLo), and Swim High-
active (SwHi) rats. The reactions of these selectively-bred lines
to CMS were compared to the
reactions of non-selectively bred (NS) rats which were used as
controls. In addition, both female
and male HYPER and NS rats were examined. Sucrose intake and
preference for sucrose, as
determined by the proportion of total fluid intake that was water
intake, were measured and
analyzed. Food intake and dark and light phase motor activity were
also measured. During
CMS, stressed HYPER rats, both females and males, SUS, RES, and
SwHi rats showed lower
preference for sucrose than did non-stressed rats of the same
lines. In contrast, stressed female
NS rats did not show a different preference for sucrose than
non-stressed female NS rats, and
stressed male NS rats tended to show higher preference for sucrose
than non-stressed male NS
rats. Stressed SwLo rats also did not show a different preference
for sucrose than non-stressed
SwLo rats. The effects on preference for sucrose could not be
explained by a change in caloric
intake as evidenced by patterns in food and water intake. Taken
together, these results suggest
that genetics can influence the outcome of CMS with respect to
effects of stress on preference for
sucrose and thus the known behavioral characteristics of a rat line
should be taken into
consideration when selecting animals for use in CMS
experiments.","Introduction - 1 -- Methods - 5 -- Animals and Housing Conditions -

A study of incipient speciation between Drosophila
albomicans and D. nasuta
By Fitsum Woldesellassie
Two fruit fly species, Drosophila nasuta and D.
albomicans, are closely related incipient species. These two
species have allopatric distribution and are morphologically
indistinguishable. Past studies reported inconsistent results on
their pre-zygotic isolation but little data on their post-zygotic
isolation. Notably, sex-ratio meiotic drive was observed in the F1
male from Okinawan D. albomicans female crossed to Indian
D. nasuta male‚ but not from the reciprocal cross.
Fertile hybrids and perpetual hybrid population can be easily made
between these two species in lab, thus questioning their status as
separate species. Here, I address the issue of speciation status by
assessing the pre-mating and post-zygotic isolations between D.
albomicans and D. nasuta. We assayed the courtship
behavior by direct observation and the mating frequency by multiple
choice test. The courtship behavior between these two species did
not differ from that within species, and the mating frequency was
also similar between and within species. Overall, there is none or
at best very weak pre-mating isolation between these two species.
Through a novel test protocol that allows us to accurately quantify
sperm production, we compared fertility among F1 males from both
reciprocal crosses within species and between species. The F1 male
from Okinawan D. albomicans female x Indian D. nasuta
male‚ produced very few sperm, just about 5% of that by the
reciprocal male, who produced significantly more sperm than the
intraspecific control. We also found gross abnormality in
spermatogenesis accompanying sperm reduction. The concurrence of
sex-ratio meiotic drive and hybrid male sterility suggests a
possible causal link in between, consistent with the theory that
genomic conflict in general, sex-ratio meiotic drive in particular,
is a predominant evolutionary force in speciation.","Table of Contents -- Introduction

There's More Than Meets the Eye: Looking at Art as an Alternative
Investment
By Hannah Levenkron
This paper examines prices and returns of the paintings of the
world's top 500 artists. I compared
this index to other financial assets, including the S&amp;P 500
index, ten-year government bonds,
and three-month treasury bills. I use these comparisons to observe
fine art as an alternative
investment over the period 1960 - 2010. Based on the art index, I
found that art realizes an
annual return of 12%, the highest of all the financial assets. It
also has a high standard deviation
and low Sharpe Ratio, which indicates that art is a very risky
asset. My CAPM regression results
show that art has a market beta of .79 and it correlates positively
with equities, having a
correlation coefficient of 13.9%. These results show that art is
not an attractive alternative
investment to stocks. I also performed autoregression analysis and
found that the art index leads
the S&amp;P 500 index and the art market has recovered quicker from
the recent financial crisis than
the equity market. These results show that art might be a good
predictor of the future state of the
world's economy. However, despite its high returns, art has a lot
of risk, which makes it an
unappealing investment.","Table of Contents -- 1. Introduction -- 2. Background Literature --

Social Learning across Cultures: Universality and Cultural
Variability
The propensity for humans to transmit culture, skills, knowledge
and information is
unmatched in other species. Social learning mechanisms such as
teaching and imitation
have been investigated and various theoretical perspectives exist.
Recently, a theory
known as Natural Pedagogy suggests that the human capacity to
transmit culture rests on
a non-verbal communicative mechanism enabling humans to teach, or
draw attention to
relevant features during skill transmission. This theory has been
refuted by ethnographic
reports of an absence of teaching in many societies. I examined
three different aspects of
non-verbal social learning across cultures. First, I collected
structured naturalistic
observations of mother-infant face-to-face interactions across
cultures, specifically
examining non-verbal behaviors in three societies, Fiji, Kenya and
US for evidence of
contingent responding and affect mirroring. I report evidence for
cross cultural
universality in maternal responsiveness and affect mirroring, with
cultural variations in
the magnitude of affect mirroring. The frequency of these behaviors
was low across all
sites and implications for these findings are discussed. Next, I
analyzed and compared
acoustic properties of speech samples directed toward an infant and
an adult in a non-
western sample (Fiji and Kenya) and a western sample (US). I report
the first acoustic
evidence for the universality in infant directed speech. Age and
education were
significant predictors of the degree to which mothers modified
their speech. Last, I
examined the propensity to teach in six societies. I report the
first universal evidence of
non-verbal pedagogical signals across cultures. Implications
regarding the Natural
Pedagogy theory as well as current perspectives on the function of
maternal
responsiveness and affect mirroring in early caregiver-infant
interactions are discussed.","Table of Contents -- General Introduction
