Differential Effects of Meditation on Relationship Quality
By Brighid Malloy Kleinman
Relationships are one of the most crucial parts of life and a
highly studied subject
in psychology. Yet psychologists still have difficulty explaining
how to help people gain
and maintain close, positive relationships. The present study aims
to investigate whether
an existing intrapersonal health strategy, meditation, can also
help interpersonal health.
Specifically, psychological and neurobiological evidence suggests
that compassion
mediation in particular may be particularly relevant to close
relationships. Based on
evidence suggesting that compassion - the desire to free others
from suffering - is
strongly related to relationship quality, it is hypothesized that
the cultivation of
compassion through meditation will enhance self-reported
relationship quality.
Furthermore, it is hypothesized that interpersonal (i.e.,
compassion, empathy, and
forgiveness) and intrapersonal (i.e., emotion regulation and
coping) variables will
mediate the relationship between compassion meditation and
relationship quality.","Table of Contents --

Conception","This thesis begins by setting out to explore the question ""What
is God?"" Realizing that both the term and the concept of ""God""
exist within particular socio-religious contexts (and even within
such contexts, there are disconnects between conceptions of ""God""),
the question could not be approached as posed. Instead, the
question had to be subsumed within the larger sphere of
metaphysical conception in general. Metaphysical conception, as
broadly defined in this thesis, includes such conceptions as
Platonic ""forms,"" ideals such as Love and Liberty, utopian and
dystopian conceptions, absolute ""being"" or ""essencelessness,"" the
absolute nature of the self, and so forth. Simply, this thesis sets
out to explore how it is that we hold metaphysical conceptions at
all, given that our perceptual experience is limited to physical
objects of perception. In order to approach this problem, this
thesis employs the phenomenological perspectives of twentieth
century philosophers Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger, as
well as contemporary phenomenologists John Russon and Kym Maclaren,
as its theoretical lens with which to explore the nature of
subjective perception and how subjective perception lends itself
toward metaphysical conception.
The first two chapters of this thesis perform phenomenological
reflection on the appearance of objects and persons. Taken
together, these two initial chapters iterate the phenomenological
concept that objects of perception, from the most mundane inanimate
objects to behaviorally complex persons, do not appear as static,
independent entities; rather, phenomena always appear as
spatio-temporally oriented and open to inexhaustible appropriation.
The ""horizons"" of phenomenal appearance are fundamental to
perception and highlight the way in which phenomena necessarily
appear as resistant to complete appropriation or definition. The
examples of language and art are used as two examples of which the
horizons of phenomenal appearance are explicit. Finally, with
twentieth century theologian Karl Rahner's concept of ""man as
transcendent being,"" this thesis emphasizes the a priori
structure of man's very being-in-the-world as open. The concluding
claim of this thesis is that the phenomenological horizons so
fundamental to man's perceptual inherence in the world are the
basis of metaphysical conception.","Introduction: The Problem of Metaphysical Conception 2 -- I.

human epilepsy disorders: Genetic Epilepsy with Febrile Seizure
Plus (GEFS+) and Dravet Syndrome (DS). Electrophysiological
analysis of cortical and hippocampal neurons from mouse models of
GEFS+ and DS led to the hypothesis that these disorders arise from
reduced excitability of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. To test
this hypothesis, I examined the effect of preferentially deleting
Scn1a from either inhibitory interneurons or
excitatory pyramidal cells in the forebrain. I found that the
heterozygous deletion of Scn1a from interneurons
(mainly parvalbumin) resulted in spontaneous seizures and increased
seizure susceptibility. In contrast, seizure thresholds were not
significantly altered following the deletion of Scn1a from pyramidal cells.
Due to the frequent occurrence of early-life febrile seizures
(FS) in patients with SCN1A mutations, I also
evaluated mice expressing the human SCN1A GEFS+
mutation R1648H for susceptibility to hyperthermia-induced
seizures. Specifically, I compared the average seizure induction
temperature, seizure latency, duration and severity between mutant
and wildtype (WT) littermates. I found that the severity of the
induced febrile seizure was age dependent; however, the other
parameters examined did not vary with age. In addition, I
investigated whether prolonged early-life FS influence adult
seizure phenotypes. To achieve this, I developed two paradigms; one
modeling a single prolonged FS (PLFS), and the other modeling
repetitive FS (A/PLFS). Mice subjected to each paradigm were
evaluated for seizure susceptibility and spontaneous seizure
frequency at months post FS induction. Of important clinical
relevance, I found that early-life prolonged FS reduces seizure
thresholds and increases the frequency of spontaneous seizures
during adulthood.
Many patients with SCN1A mutations do not
achieve adequate seizure control with available medications and
there is an urgent need to develop better treatment strategies. As
a result, I evaluated the efficacy of the ketogenic diet (KD) as a
potential non-pharmacological treatment for DS and GEFS+. I found
that the KD was able to elevate seizure thresholds in mouse models
of GEFS+ and DS to levels that were not statistically different
from WT littermates. Lastly, I determined if genetic factors might
contribute to the efficacy of the KD. I observed that the effect of
the diet on seizure thresholds varied between different inbred
strains of mice, suggesting that genetic factors are likely to
influence efficacy in the human population.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND -- 1-1.

Selling to the Souls of Black Folk:
Atlanta, Reverend J.M. Gates, the Phonograph, and the
Transformation of African
American Protestantism and Culture, 1910-1945 .
By Lerone A. Martin
There is much work in the discipline of American religious history
that chronicles
the significance of mass mediums such as print, radio, film,
television, and the Internet in
the practice(s) of Protestant Christianity. However, the field has
been slow to recognize
the phonograph as an equally vital tool within these traditions.
Selling to the Souls of
Black Folk takes up this neglected task by historically
tracing the phenomenon of African
American Protestant clergy utilizing the phonograph for the mass
transmission of their
sermons during the first half of the Twentieth century. This
unprecedented use of mass
communication and religious commodification enabled black clergy,
who were largely
marginalized from radio, to become cultural celebrities, alongside
popular music artists,
within African American communities. Leading record labels recorded
these spiritual
commodities and advertised them in black newspapers, posters,
handbills, department
stores, mail-order catalogues, record label shops, and furniture
stores. As a result, the
placement of these sermons on the market shelf significantly
altered the substance and
form of black religious practices. This story examines several of
the approximately one
hundred African American phonograph sermon recorders prior to World
War II.
However, Atlanta and the city's Reverend J.M. Gates, the most
prolific phonograph
sermon recorder, are the anchors of this historical study. This
conceptual lynchpin allows
for a concentrated analysis of how the emergence and popularity of
phonograph sermons
both reflected and facilitated shifts within African American
Protestantism. Selling to the
Souls of Black Folk, therefore, offers an important
historical account that is essential to
understanding the major trends and practices that undergird
contemporary American
Protestantism and religious broadcasting.

a form of
apoptosis, referred to as ""anoikis."" Most cancer cells are
resistant to anoikis and survive
independently of ECM interactions. Previously, we identified a
pro-apoptotic gene,
TMS1 that is epigenetically silenced in breast cancers.
Overexpression of TMS1 is
sufficient to induce procaspase-8 cleavage in breast cells in the
absence of death receptor-
ligand interactions. Additionally, TMS1 aggregates to form 'specks'
in some apoptotic
cells, although the function of this structure remains unclear.
Here we established a role
for TMS1 in anoikis and uncovered a nonapoptotic role for TMS1 in
cell migration. We
show that cellular detachment induces TMS1 expression. In addition,
we find that
silencing TMS1 confers resistance to anoikis through a delay in
procaspase-8 cleavage
and accumulation of BimEL. ERK1/2 signaling negatively regulates
BimEL
accumulation during detachment. We found that silencing TMS1
resulted in persistent
ERK1/2 signaling during anoikis. We conclude that loss of TMS1
promotes resistance to
anoikis in part through misregulation of ERK1/2 signaling and
suppression of BimEL
accumulation. During the course of these studies a nonapoptotic
role for procaspase-8 in
adhesion and migration was elucidated by many groups. The next
phase of our research
was aimed towards deciphering a role for TMS1 upstream of
procaspase-8 in anoikis.
Thus, we next investigated a nonapoptotic role for TMS1 in these
processes. We found
that adhesion to fibronectin induced the redistribution of TMS1 to
barrel-like structures.
Silencing TMS1 delayed FAK and ERK1/2 signaling in response to
integrin-fibronectin
interactions. Phosphorylated FAK and centrosomal markers
colocalized with TMS1 at
barrel-like structures in a subset of cells. Through functional
analyses, we further
demonstrated a role for TMS1 in cell migration. These data
suggest that an association of
TMS1 with centrosomes results in the formation of a critical
signaling center that may
regulate migration. In conclusion, our data demonstrate distinct
functions for TMS1 in
anoikis and migration. Overall, results from these studies have
increased our
understanding of the intricate functions TMS1 exhibits in
epithelial cells and has
provided great insight into the consequences of aberrant
methylation and silencing of
TMS1 observed in many cancers.",

Exposure in Michigan","In a study of geographic distribution of human exposure to
polybrominated biphenyl in the Michigan PBB Registry, following a
contamination incident in 1973, PBB quarantined farms are
investigated for their potential as sites of environmental
contamination and continued human exposure to PBB. Spatial
distribution maps were created to describe human PBB exposure from
1976-1979, quarantined farms, estimated decay rates, and breast
cancer rates by county. Univariate geostatistical analyses assessed
global and local autocorrelation. Bivariate geostatistical analyses
evaluated global and local autocorrelation of human PBB exposure,
estimated decay rates, and breast cancer rates with the number of
quarantined farms in Michigan counties. A land use analysis
measured the area of agricultural land in 1978 developed into urban
land use in 1992, in counties with the highest number of
quarantined farms. No significant global autocorrelation was found
across the state of Michigan for any variable, with the exception
of mean breast cancer rates. Results of the local univariate
analyses indicated differential distribution of PBB exposure. Three
major areas associated with higher human PBB exposure were located
around the city of Grand Rapids, in the thumb of Michigan's lower
peninsula, and in the southwestern corner of the state. Bivariate
significant autocorrelation with quarantined farms was found at
these same locations. The land use analyses revealed counties
located around the city of Grand Rapids had the greatest total land
area transition from agriculture to urban land use. In the thumb of
the state, significant bivariate autocorrelation identified an area
of high of quarantined farms and slower decay rates. In conclusion,
this study identifies areas of Michigan associated with higher
human exposure to PBB in 1976-1979. This analysis suggests that
counties around the city of Grand Rapids have a higher potential
for continued human exposure to PBB from quarantined farms and that
slower rates of decay found in the thumb of the state, can
potentially be attributed to continued human exposure from
quarantined farms. The implications of these findings can be better
understood through environmental sampling, more detailed land use
data analyses, and continued spatial analyses of point
locations.","INTRODUCTION 1 -- METHODS 14 -- Study Population: Michigan PBB

Michigan Chemical Corporation and Pine River Community","Purpose: After the industrial accident in
1973 in Michigan exposed thousands of people to polybrominated
biphenyls (PBB), the Michigan PBB Registry was started to track the
exposed to conduct research on health outcomes. In the 1990s those
who were former chemical workers of Michigan Chemical Corporation
and their families were dropped from the registry due to multiple
exposures. In 2014, former PBB Registry participants were invited
to re-join the Registry. This study aims to characterize the
chemical workers, their families, and others living in the
St.Louis/Pine River area who may have been exposed to PBB and other
persistent organic pollutants.
Methods: Blood samples were collected from
participants in December, 2013 and in March, 2014. Serum was
analyzed for PBB153, DDT and DDE isomers, and HBB.
Participant's serum concentrations were coupled with
questionnaire data about their demographic
classifications. Univariate statistics were used to describe
the study cohort's chemical distributions. The study
cohort distributions were compared with NHANES
2003-2004 distributions as a baseline indicator of national
background concentrations. Linear regression was performed on
natural log transformed PBB153 and p,p-DDE concentrations as the
dependent outcomes with covariates of the different
classifications.
Results: Chemical workers had significantly
higher PBB153 concentrations than the other three classifications
of participants that stayed significant when adjusted for age and
gender. Family members of chemical workers had significantly higher
PBB153 concentrations than the other two classifications of
participants that stayed significant when adjusted for age and
gender. Age was the only strong predictor of p,p-DDE
concentrations. All participants measured below the level of
detection for DDT isomers, o,p-DDE, and HBB. The overall
distribution of the study cohort had elevated PBB153 concentrations
compared with the NHANES 2003-2004 data.
Conclusion: This study highlights the need
for chemical workers and their families to be included back into
the Michigan PBB Registry, as they represent a highly exposed
population to PBB. Future studies should focus on linking
environmental sampling of persistent organic pollutants in St.
Louis/Pine River to human exposures -
including reassessing DDT/DDE/DDD as well as other compounds
such as PCB, PBDE, and dieldrin.","Introduction......................................1 --

Youth sexual and reproductive health in Bosnia and

Informing intervention strategies using quantitative methods
by Glen R. Abedi
Youth sexual and reproductive health represents an area of
healthcare that is in particular need of
development in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, little research on this
subject has been conducted to date
to guide policy and programming. CARE Northwest Balkans, a regional
subsidiary of CARE
International, completed a quantitative survey on youth sexual and
reproductive health in Bosnia-
Herzegovina in 2006. Respondents consisted(Mann, Drucker,
Tarantola, &amp; McCabe, 1994) of university
students above the age of 18. They answered questions about their
behaviors and attitudes associated with
sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and related behaviors.
The largest ethnic group represented in the sample was Serbs
(71.56%), followed by Bosniaks
(23.85%). The median age of respondents was 22.21 years. Only 5.50%
of respondents reported ever
having been tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI)
although 69.72% reported having engaged in
sexual intercourse in the previous year. The most popular sources
of information on sexual and
reproductive health were TV &amp; radio, printed materials, and
school. The effectiveness of these sources of
information as avenues for public health communications remains
unclear.

Depression Medication Use Among Women Exposed to Polybrominated
Biphenyls,
Michigan 1997-2006
Objective: This study examined the potential
association of dietary exposure to
polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), a brominated flame retardant, and
self-reported use of
depression medication among women. PBBs belong to a class of
chemical that have
demonstrated disruption of endocrine systems and pathway. Onset of
depression may be
due to many factors but gender differences in prevalence and the
vulnerability of women
during reproductive lifetime events, such as menses, pregnancy, the
postpartum period
and menopause, suggest the involvement of reproductive
hormones.
Methods: Women exposed to PBB in the early 1970s were
enrolled in a population-based
cohort and provided blood serum samples to ascertain PBB
concentrations in the body.
This study includes 901 women who participated in interviews
conducted in 1997-1998
or in 2003-2006. Information collected during the interviews
included demographics,
lifestyle, medical history, reproductive history, and exposure
history. Logistic regression
models for use of depression medication in the year prior to
interview used enrollment
PBB exposure and current PBB exposure. A general linear mixed decay
model using
enrollment PBB concentrations estimated current PBB concentrations.
All models were
adjusted for PCB levels at enrollment, age at interview, history of
thyroid disease, history
of cancer, BMI at interview, smoking status, and use of hormone
replacement therapy.
Results: Depression medication use in the 12 months
prior to interview was reported for
133 women, with an overall prevalence of 14.8%. This study did not
find an association
between exposure to PBB and depression medication usage among
women, however
among current or former smokers with PBB exposure an increased
likelihood of
depression medication use was observed compared to non-smokers with
low PBB
exposure. (Current PBB &lt;0.85 ppb: OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.32;
Current PBB 0.85 ≤ 2.4
ppb: OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.00-3.43; Enrollment PBB ≤1 ppb: OR
1.56, 95% CI 1.05-2.30;
Enrollment PBB 1 - 4 ppb: OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41)
Conclusion: This study suggests that PBB exposure
increases the chance of depression
among women who are current or former smokers. Additional research
should explore
the interaction between PBBs and smoking and depression associated
with altered
hormone pathways.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I: Literature Review

Conditions, Water and Sanitation Infrastructure and Practices, and
Fecal Contamination in Four Low-Income Neighborhoods in Accra,
Ghana","Introduction: Rapidly-growing, low-income urban environments
often have poor water and sanitation services that can lead to
exposure to fecal contamination in the public domain. This study
describes and compares the demographics, socioeconomic conditions,
and physical characteristics of four low-income urban neighborhoods
in Accra, Ghana. Water, sanitation and hygiene conditions and
practices and environmental fecal contamination levels were
compared.
Methods: Household surveys were administered to residents in
four study neighborhoods (Alajo, Bukom, Old Fadama, Shiabu) in
Accra, Ghana. Residents were asked about demographic,
infrastructural characteristics, sanitation practices related to
latrine usage, drinking and cooking water sources, and water
storage practices. Environmental samples (soil, sand, drain
sediment, drain water, flood sediment, and flood water) were
collected, and analyzed for E. coli. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) procedures or chi-squared and Fisher's tests were used to
compare household characteristics and practices by neighborhood.
After analyzing the distributions of E. coli concentration
for each type of environmental sample through ANOVAs and kernel
density distributions, a weighted fecal contamination score was
created, stratifying by both sample type and neighborhood, to
compare E. coli concentrations.
Results: Study neighborhoods differed significantly in most
demographic, infrastructure, sanitation- and hygiene-specific
characteristics. E. coli levels were the highest in drain
water samples (mean:8.56 log10CFUs), followed by floodwater samples
(mean:6.77 log10CFUs), but significant heterogeneity was only
observed in sediment samples from flood areas. Shiabu had the
greatest proportion of environmental samples with E. coli
categorization, and the highest E. coli concentrations.
Discussion: Differences in neighborhood socioeconomic and
structural characteristics were associated with differences in
fecal contamination in the urban environment. There was significant
heterogeneity in neighborhood-specific access to improved
sanitation. Neighborhoods more likely to experience flooding events
had higher fecal contamination levels in flood-related samples;
otherwise, drain samples had the highest fecal contamination
levels. Only sediment samples from flood areas had average E.
coli concentrations that were significantly different between
neighborhoods. Fecal contamination in the public domain may pose a
serious health risk to low-income urban populations. The
relationship between urban drainage, flooding, and fecal
contamination in low-income neighborhoods should be further
investigated.","Table of Contents -- Abbreviations 1 -- I. Background 3 -- A.

Introduction:
Resistance of M. tuberculosis to anti-tuberculosis drugs
has become a
major public health problem in many countries, including Georgia.
In 2008, Georgian
National Tuberculosis Program introduced treatment with second line
anti-tuberculosis
drugs, which has allowed for treatment of multidrug or extensively
drug-resistant
tuberculosis (M/XDR)-TB. The study objectives were to assess
treatment outcomes
among the 1st cohort of patients with pulmonary M/XDR-TB and to
determine risk factors
for poor treatment outcomes: defined as death, failure and
default.
Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was
performed. All patients with
M/XDR pulmonary TB who initiated treatment in 2008 were enrolled
and followed until
2010. Descriptive statistics were used to determine associations
between study
covariates. Binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to
determine independent
association of prior treatment history with treatment outcome while
controlling for
potential confounding variables.
Results: 380 patients were included: male (71%); mean age 38
years; median age 38.4
years. 13% had XDR-TB. 1.3% had HIV co-infection. Body Mass Index
(BMI) was &lt;18.5
among 24% of the cohort, and 52% had bilateral lesions on chest
X-ray. Surgery was
performed in 10% (37) of cases. The treatment outcomes were as
follows: 47% had a
poor outcome (death among 59 patients [15%], failure among 37
[10%], and 83 [22%] -
defaulted). In the final multivariable analysis, history of
previous treatment (OR=2.8 95%
CI 1.2 - 6.3) was significantly associated with poor treatment
after controlling for risk
factors. Other independent variables associated with poor treatment
outcomes included
absence of adjunctive surgical therapy (OR 3.7, 95%CI 1.5, 8.7), no
sputum culture
conversion to negative by 4 months (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.9, 5.0), the
presence of XDR-TB
(OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2, 2.4), BMI &lt; 18.5 (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1, 3.4)
and bilateral lesions on
chest radiograph (OR 1.8, 95%CI 1.2, 2.9).
Conclusions: Overall, 47% of patients with M/XDR-TB had poor
treatment outcome. In
multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for a poor
treatment outcome included
prior TB treatment history, lack of adjunctive surgical
intervention, no culture conversion
by month 4, XDR-TB, low BMI (&lt;18.5) and bilateral lesions on
chest X-ray.

Consuming News as a Millennial: Undergraduates' News Consumption
Practices and Their
Effects on Identity Formation and Civic Engagement

This study aims to present the news consumption and civic
engagement habits of a select group
of undergraduate students at a major research university. By
building upon the research methods and
frameworks used by Dr. Debra Spitulnik Vidali (2006-present), the
present research aims to reveal how
undergraduate students think about and use news material in their
daily lives to form individual
identities and develop connections among social groups and
democratic institutions. Individuals' habits
and perceptions with respect to news consumption and civic
engagement were revealed through
facilitated smal group interviews and written surveys.
This paper argues that undergraduates' news consumption and civic
engagement habits are
highly personalized and largely shaped by peer influence. Students
who currently read, watch, or listen
to the news on a regular basis feel that news consumption is an
imperative habit in order to successful y
participate in classroom discussions and conversations with others
and contribute to the functioning of
the nation itself. Most students who do not consume news regularly
believe that they should be more
knowledgeable about current events in order to participate ful y in
democratic processes, but cite a lack
of time and personal relevance as reasons why they do not actively
seek this knowledge. As a result, I
argue that undergraduates' media ideologies and idioms of practice
surrounding news media outlets,
and particularly Internet--based outlets, are informing further
personalization of news and civic
engagement. While current preferences toward personalized news
consumption and civic engagement
are both constructive and valid, they cannot replace the knowledge
of informed citizenship that
promotes the overal health of a democratic country. In order for
democracy to survive in the hands of
the millennials, I argue that news must be considered relevant and
important in the context of everyday
lives of these individuals.","Table of Contents -- I.

about during the
nineteenth century had a resounding effect on Victorian culture.
The advent of the
railway along with the introduction of new communications media and
radical biological
and geological discoveries had major implications for western
society's understanding of
the relationship between space and time and of humanity's role
within that relationship.
As time and space were expanded, the speed at which they could be
experienced caused
them to be simultaneously annihilated, greatly increasing the
number of impressions -
and the amount of experience - an individual could acquire. By the
1890s, the effects of
this phenomenon had become some of the most widely discussed topics
in a multitude of
cultural discourses, and since, as H. Porter Abbott writes in the
Cambridge Introduction
to Narrative, ""the representation of conflict in narrative
provides a way for a culture to
talk to itself about, and possibly resolve, conflicts that threaten
to fracture it (or at least
making living difficult),"" the literature produced during the last
decade of the century
exemplifies the extent to which these changes influenced society on
both individual and
collective levels.1 This thesis focuses on two works by Henry James

Screw and In the Cage, both published in 1898 - as well
as H. G. Wells's The Time
Machine, published in 1895. Shortly after these works were
introduced into Victorian
culture, James and Wells became involved in a lifelong quarrel
regarding the purpose of
the novel: Wells adeptly explained it in a 1915 letter to James
when he stated, ""to you
literature like painting is an end, to me literature like
architecture is a means, it has a
use.""2 Despite their differences - as Wells confessed, ""I had a
queer feeling that we were
both incompatibly right"" - both authors address the newly-realized
ambiguity of the
relationships between time and space, truth and fiction, man and
machine.3","Table of Contents --

polygamy is a poor choice. It argues from experience, with detailed
reference to the Jewish legal system's dramatic move away from the
practice of plural marriage.","Table of Contents -- INTRODUCTION.......................................................................................................................................................................

Determinants of Uncontrolled Blood Pressure among African
Americans using Electronic Medical Records, 2008-2011
By Yi-Ting Chou
Hypertension is a common chronic disease affecting more than 75
million adults in the United States. Particularly in African
Americans, hypertension is more common, more severe, develops at an
earlier age, and leads to more clinical sequelae. Moreover,
Hypertension control rates in the United States remain lower in
African Americans compared to Caucasians. Nevertheless, potential
risk factors of uncontrolled hypertension have not been
sufficiently investigated in clinical population.
To understand the multidimensional determinants of uncontrolled
blood pressure in African Americans, we used an electronic medical
record system in Georgia and identified a sample of 3,135 newly
treated hypertensive African Americans aged ≥20. The primary
outcomes of interest were 1) Blood pressure (BP) controlled or not
after treatment, and 2) the quantitative changes in SBP and DBP
before and after treatment. Potential risk factors examined
included age, sex, BMI, Socioeconomic status socioeconomic status,
medication adherence, the use of diuretics or calcium channel
blockers, comorbidities. The associations of risk factors with
blood pressure and uncontrolled hypertension were examined by
linear and logistic regression models, respectively.
Under the unadjusted model, medication adherence (medication
possession ratio ≥0.8) was significantly associated with BP
control with a reduction of 5.4 and 3.3 mmHg compared to
non-adherent patient in SBP and DBP respectively. The use of
diuretics was associated with a reduction in SBP while the use of
CCB was observed with association in both SBP and DBP response.
Diabetes (DM), stroke, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end stage
renal disease (ESRD) were associated with SBP increases even after
treatment. Controlling for age, sex, BMI, and medication adherence,
diuretics was still significantly associated with a SBP reduction
but not DBP. DM was associated with DBP reduction, while CKD or
ESRD was associated with increases in SBP, respectively. Low SES is
associated with less reduction of SBP and DBP among treated African
Americans.
We concluded that adherence to antihypertensive medication, the
comorbidity, and the category of antihypertensive medication
strongly influenced BP response among African Americans.","Table of Contents -- Background/Literature

Biological Pattern Recognition Approach","Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into
all somatic cell types, making them a useful platform for studying
a variety of cellular phenomenon. Furthermore, ESCs can be induced
to form aggregates called embryoid bodies (EBs) which recapitulate
the dynamics of development and morphogenesis. However, many
different factors such as gradients of soluble morphogens, direct
cell-to-cell signaling, and cell-matrix interactions have all been
implicated in directing ESC differentiation. Though the effects of
individual factors have often been investigated independently, the
inherent difficulty in assaying combinatorial effects has made it
difficult to ascertain the concerted effects of different
environmental parameters, particularly due to the spatial and
temporal dynamics associated with such cues. Dynamic computational
models of ESC differentiation can provide powerful insight into how
different cues function in combination both spatially and
temporally. By combining particle based diffusion models, cellular
agent based approaches, and physical models of morphogenesis, a
multi-scale, rules-based modeling framework can provide insight
into how each component contributes to differentiation. I propose
to investigate the complex regulatory cues which govern complex
morphogenic behavior in 3D ESC systems via a computational rules
based modeling approach. The objective of this study is to examine
how spatial patterns of differentiation by ESCs arise as a function
of the microenvironment. The central hypothesis is that spatial
control of soluble morphogens and cell-cell signaling will allow
enhanced control over the patterns and efficiency of stem cell
differentiation in embryoid bodies.",

nonEmo Phenotype in C. elegans Oocytes","I am currently investigating a novel oocyte phenotype in
the nematode C. elegans. Unlike human oocytes, which remain
meiotically arrested unless fertilized, ovulated C. elegans
oocytes undergo continuous endomitotic DNA replication and
consequentially become polyploid when left unfertilized. Wild type
(WT) worms therefore, are said to have an ""Emo""
(endomitotic oocyte)
phenotype. A novel ""nonEmo"" phenotype was discovered when a strain
that contained him-8(e1462) was found to produce
ovulated oocytes that remained arrested in meiotic prophase I when
left unfertilized. Because oocyte meiotic arrest would greatly aid
in the process of realizing an in vitro fertilization (IVF)
model in C. elegans, understanding the genetic basis of this
strain's nonEmo phenotype is important, as it has the potential to
produce oocytes of a quantity and quality suitable for IVF in C.
elegans. C. elegans fertilization in vivo is
difficult to observe, as it is tightly coupled to ovulation and
occurs rapidly in a chamber (the spermatheca) filled with sperm
that block the view of the oocyte. IVF is desired, as it would
allow for an unobstructed view of sperm-oocyte interactions prior
to fertilization and control of variables such as the location,
time, and environment of sperm-egg binding. IVF would also allow
detailed spatial and temporal analyses of sperm mutants that
exhibit defects during fertilization. I have used PCR, DNA
sequencing, RNAi technology, and conventional genetics to show that
loss-of-function mutations in the gene C10C5.1 are
responsible for the nonEmo phenotype. This gene encodes a Piezo
protein, which is postulated to function as a mechanosensitive ion
channel. My work has taken a strain that harbored multiple
mutations and clearly shown that the nonEmo phenotype results from
loss-of-function for one gene. Future work will focus
on determining the tissue in which lack of C10C5.1 expression
causes the nonEmo phenotype. Along with investigating how the
nonEmo phenotype is regulated, further work will need to be
performed to determine if C10C5.1 mutants are in fact suitable
oocyte donors for IVF.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Introduction -- A. Caenorhabditis

Population","Introduction: Obesity has become one of the United States' most
pressing public health issues. Almost 35% of Americans are obese
according to most recent prevalence data. Research on eating
behaviors has shown that eating while distracted can cause people
to consume more than they realize, with small changes in awareness
leading to lowered ability to self-regulate food consumption. Most
research on distracted eating has been conducted in controlled
settings. However, observing overall behavioral trends in
free-living adults can garner insight into the effect that
secondary eating, or eating while engaged in other activities, has
on body composition. This analysis assesses the relationship
between time spent engaged in secondary eating and obesity.

Methods: Data for this analysis on 11,369 adult respondents were
taken from the 2008 American Time Use Survey, a cross-sectional
survey conducted to obtain nationally representative estimates on
how Americans spend their time. In 2008, the supplemental Eating
and Health Module was conducted to obtain information directly
related to food and eating behaviors. Three logistic regression
models were run to observe the association between BMI and
secondary eating: one unadjusted, one adjusting for selected
demographic characteristics, and one adjusting for selected
demographic characteristics and selected time use variables.
Results: The sample used in this analysis had a mean BMI of 27.4
and a median BMI of 26.6. 53% of all respondents engaged in
secondary eating during the day. Non-obese respondents spent on
average 0.53 hours engaged in secondary eating per day, while obese
respondents spent on average 0.38 hours. In all three models, those
who spent more than 30 minutes engaged in secondary eating had
lower odds of being obese (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-0.95) compared
to those who did not engage in secondary eating at all.

Discussion: This analysis observed lower odds of obesity in those
who spent longer engaged in secondary eating. This relationship
could have been influenced by the volume and types of food
typically consumed during secondary eating occasions. Future
research focused on capturing differences in types of food consumed
during secondary eating is necessary to further explore this
behavior.","Table of Contents -- Introduction/Statement of

Drinking from the Byzantine Tradition: John Wesley's Synthetic
Understanding of
Anthropology, Soteriology, and Teleology.
By Robert Steven Reneau
During his life and the centuries after his death, many scholars
see the theology of
John Wesley as attempting to bridge a gap between Roman Catholicism
and
Protestantism. However, since Albert C. Outler mentioned in a
footnote of the bottom his
book titled John Wesley in 1964 that Wesley also pulled from
the early Byzantine
tradition, scholars are now attempting to place Wesley's work in a
new light that attempts
to bridge the paradigms of the Western church and Eastern church.
This work shows how
Wesley forged a synthetic understanding of anthroplogy,
soteriology, and teleology that
is heavily based in Western notions, but also drawing from multiple
early Greek voices
like Clement of Alexandrius, Macarius/Gregory of Nyssa, and
Chrysostom.

non-pathogenic SIV infection","After more than twenty-five years of strenuous research, an
effective AIDS vaccine to prevent
HIV infection has yet to be developed. This is largely due to a
lack of understanding of how HIV
interacts with the human immune system and causes pathogenesis. The
goal of my thesis was to
better understand determinants of viremia during HIV pathogenesis
by utilizing non-human
primate models. Natural SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SMs)
provides a non-pathogenic
model of HIV, since despite high levels of viremia, these animals
maintain peripheral CD4+ T
cells and do not progress to AIDS. Pathogenic SIV infection of
rhesus macaques (RMs),
however, is a widely used model for HIV in humans since these
animals have high viremia,
depletion of peripheral CD4+ T cells, and eventual progression to
AIDS. In the first aim of my
thesis, I assessed the determinants of set-point viremia in
naturally SIV-infected SMs, i.e.,
immune control versus target cell limitation. To address this
issue, I depleted CD4+ T cells in
naturally SIV-infected SMs, and found that set-point viremia is
determined by the availability of
activated CD4+ T cells, but not measures of immune control. In the
second aim of my thesis, I
sought to better understand the role of CD8+ T cells during
pathogenic SIV infection of RMs by
determining the lifespan of SIV-infected cells in vivo
either in the presence (control) or absence
(CD8+ lymphocyte-depleted) of CD8+ T cells. I found that depletion
of CD8+ lymphocytes did
not result in an increased lifespan of productively infected cells
in vivo, which indicates that
direct killing of cells producing virus is unlikely to be a major
mechanism underlying the anti-
viral effect of CD8+ T cells during SIV infection. Taken together,
the results of my thesis studies
have important implications for the development of AIDS vaccines
and therapies. These studies
provide a significant improvement in our understanding of the
complex interactions between HIV
and the immune system, and will hopefully lead to a re-analysis of
current HIV vaccination
strategies in order to produce more efficacious vaccines with
appropriate targets.","Table of Contents -- Chapter One: Thesis Introduction

The Role of Rap1 Signaling during Prostate Cancer
Progression
and its Potential Regulator, the PI3K/Akt Pathway
By Veronica Mwihaki Henderson
Rap1 is a small G-protein implicated in the regulation of
E-cadherin cell-cell junctions
and integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions. Our expression
profiling of clinical prostate
cancer tissue samples showed significantly decreased Rap1A mRNA
levels in tumor
compared to normal tissue samples, while a negative regulator of
Rap1, Rap1GAP, was
significantly increased. Furthermore, these changes in Rap1A and
Rap1GAP expression
were significantly correlated with Gleason tumor grade, suggesting
that reduced Rap1
signals play a role in metastatic progression. Tissue microarray
analysis confirmed this
correlation at the protein level for Rap1GAP. Furthermore, siRNA
knockdown of Rap1A
and Rap1B resulted in increased LNCaP cell migration as measured in
a wound healing
assay. Stable expression of the PTEN tumor suppressor in C4-2
prostate cancer cells
resulted in changes in cell morphology as well as increased Rap1
protein levels,
suggesting that the PI3K/AKT pathway may regulate Rap1 expression.
Treatment of
prostate cancer cells with an inhibitor of PI3K increased mRNA
expression of the Rap1A
and Rap1B genes, supporting this hypothesis. Thus, activation of
the PI3K/AKT pathway
may be one mechanism by which Rap1 expression is repressed during
prostate cancer
progression, resulting in enhanced cell migration.

of Trust and Social Influence among Immigrant Latinos in North
Carolina","Early detection of HIV-positive status and entry into
treatment is the most efficacious way to prevent the spread and/or
progression of the disease. However surveillance data and cohort
studies indicate Latinos in the United States (U.S.) are more
likely than non-Latino blacks and whites to delay testing, present
to care with an AIDS defining illness, and die within one year of
learning their HIV-positive status. Recent studies have shown that
U.S. immigrants from Mexico and Central America are more likely to
delay testing and treatment compared to other foreign-born groups;
and Latinos in southeastern settlement states may delay seeking
care longer than Latinos in more established immigrant
destinations. Because time lived in the U.S. and acculturation are
often associated with increased behavioral risk and suboptimal
health outcomes among Latinos, it is important to understand how
combinations of sociopolitical and acculturative influences in new
settlement areas may affect personal health assessments,
socio-medical intuitions, and likelihood of
HIV-testing/treatment-adherence over time.
This research develops emerging theories linking
socio-acculturative factors and endorsements of trust in medical
care to HIV-prevention and public health criteria. The research
uses data collected in 2008-2009 from three NIH and extramurally
funded studies to address three specific aims: (1) Assess validity
of the adapted Wake Forest University Medical Trust Scale
among Spanish-speaking men and women from Mexico and Central
America; (2) Estimate structural relationships between
socio-acculturative influences, self-rated health status, and
HIV-testing, adjusting for length of residence in the U.S.; and (3)
Examine how legal stress and medical trust modulate effects of the
HoMBReS HIV prevention intervention. This research advances
theory and measurement of psychological processes in the most
rapidly growing U.S. populations experiencing the most severe
AIDS-related outcomes.",

streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model with bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem cells","Recent evidence has suggested that diabetic neuropathy
(DN) is pathophysiologically related to both impaired angiogenesis
and a deficiency of neurotrophic factors in the nerves. It is
widely known that vascular and neural growth are intimately
associated. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote angiogenesis in
ischemic diseases and have neuroprotective effects, particularly on
Schwann cells. Accordingly, we investigated whether DN could be
improved by local transplantation of MSCs by augmenting
angiogenesis and neural regeneration such as remyelination. In
sciatic nerves of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, motor
and sensory nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) and capillary
density were reduced, and axonal atrophy and demyelination were
observed. After injection of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs)
into hindlimb muscles, NCVs were restored to near-normal levels.
Histological examination demonstrated that injected MSCs were
preferentially and durably engrafted in the sciatic nerves, and a
portion of the engrafted MSCs were distinctively localized close to
vasa nervora of sciatic nerves. Furthermore, vasa nervora increased
in density, and ultrastructure of myelinated fibers in nerves were
observed to be restored. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed that
gene expression of multiple factors involved in angiogenesis,
neural function, and myelination were increased in the MSC-injected
nerves. These findings suggest that MSC transplantation improved DN
through direct peripheral nerve angiogenesis, neurotrophic effects,
and restoration of myelination.","Table of Contents --

the constitution of what I call the Mexican ""archive of work""
through key moments in the nation's cultural history in which
attempts were made to articulate a work ethic capable of delivering
the nation into prosperity, while at the same time remaining
authentically Mexican. I define the ""archive of work"" as a
discursive matrix composed of three conceptual nuclei--the
Christian notion of duty, the liberal notion of work as
self-development, and the thermodynamic and scientistic notion of
metabolic work--which determines all discussions of work and its
opposites in modern Mexico. My chapters engage a wide array of
written cultural objects that spans a variety of genres: from the
assorted writings, legislations, articles, speeches and novels of
19th century liberal and conservative lettered elite, to
the textual production--philosophical treatises, essays, and
novels--of the mid twentieth century. Together, these documents
allow for an exploration of the idea of work in Mexico and the
ontological and political narratives about man's place in the world
that serve as its ground.","1.0 Introduction 1 -- 1.1 The Archive of Work 9 -- 1.2 A Brief

James in the ""Q"" Sayings Tradition: An Examination of the
Jesus Logia in the Epistle of St. James
The present investigation concerns itself with assessing the
relationship between the Epistle of
James and the sayings traditions of Jesus, as found in the
Synoptics. For most observers, the use of Jesus
logia
reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the nature and
extent of the affinities between James and the Gospels remain a
matter of debate among scholars. The
questions raised
revolve around debates over which
passages in James are identifiable as derivative of a Jesus
logion. Secondarily, the extent to which James
utilizes such traditions has been recognized as a possible window
into the Sitz im Leben of the Jamesian
community (itself a notoriously difficult question).
The thesis which guides the present discussion can be stated as
follows: the Epistle of James
represents an early stage in the development of the Jesus tradition
found in the Synoptic Gospels.
Correspondingly, it reflects a pre-gospel stage of development in
the sayings of Jesus, reminiscent of the
form found in the Q source (particularly in its Matthean
recension). The two test cases for this hypothesis
will be Jas 2:5 and Jas 5:12. The reason for the selection of these
passages in particular is that they are
nearly universally accepted
of the words of Jesus. Before undertaking
an exegesis of these passages it will be necessary to briefly
review the relevant literature, in order to see
how Jamesian scholarship has developed from its origins to its
current state. Following the exegesis of the
targeted verses in James, we will conclude our investigation with a
summary of our findings and an
assessment of their implications.

in the United States. Treatment options are currently limited, and
currently only one FDA-approved therapy exists (tPA). Although tPA
was a great stride forward in stroke treatment, only a small
percentage of patients are eligible to receive the drug and even
smaller actually receive it. Research to date has focused on small
molecule and peptide based therapies aimed at neuroprotection:
protecting dying neurons, glia, and vascular from ischemia-media
cell death. Decades of pre-clinical studies generated exciting
results in animal models, however all have failed to translate to
successful patient care. Currently, there are no therapies
available to promote central nervous system (CNS recovery) in
stroke survivors. Cellular therapy, the use of stem cells for
stroke treatment, has blossomed in the lab in the past decade.
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells, or iPSCs) in particular
are an excellent candidate for future stroke therapies. With
multiple mechanisms of action and the possibility for not only
neuronal cell replacement but personalized medicine as well, the
use of iPSCs for stroke therapy holds great potential. Current
studies generate as proof-of-principal that iPSC transplantation
can be safe, efficacious, and can provide a source of new neurons
that integrate into host circuitry. While these studies are
exciting, they are far from ideal. Many questions remain and in its
current form, iPSC transplantation for stroke is not optimized and
remains inefficient. This dissertation examines how iPSC
transplantation may be optimized for ischemic stroke treatment. We
examined a novel intranasal transplantation route as well as a
novel genetic manipulation method (focal adhesion kinase, FAK,
overexpression we hypothesized would improve functional recovery
over current methods. Our results suggest that the novel
non-invasive intranasal transplantation may improve functional
recovery at a similar level compared to existing methods. We also
demonstrate FAK overexpression may improve some aspects of normal
neuronal development that would aid the integration of
transplantated cells. Taken together, our data suggest that
optimization of existing iPSC transplantation methods may benefit
iPSC therapy for ischemic stroke.","CHAPTER 1 - ISCHEMIC STROKE 1 -- INTRODUCTION 2 -- ISCHEMIC STROKE

Paul on the Road to Natchez: Conversion and Resurrection in the
Christ-Haunted South
By Mary Elizabeth Button
Paul on the Road to Natchez is a project that is comprised
of both paintings and essays in
which the conversion of Paul is imagined at various sites along the
Natchez Trace. In
each of the fifteen pieces in the series, well-know images of
Saul's conversion (some
from art history, others from family Bibles) have been reproduced
within an illustration
of sites along the Natchez Trace. Saul's journey to Damascus, and
the blinding light of
the resurrected Christ that transforms Saul into Paul, provides the
narrative structure for
the project.

Transfusions:
Mechanisms, Consequences, and Interventions

By
Seema Rajnikant Patel
In response to vasculature injury, anucleated cell fragments,
referred to as platelets,
adhere and aggregate to damaged blood vessels to preserve
hemostasis through clot
formation and wound healing. Platelet disorders resulting in low
platelet counts or
dysfunctional platelets can require aggressive platelet transfusion
support to aid in
maintaining proper hemostasis levels. Although a vital therapy,
platelet transfusions are
associated with long-term clinical consequences, such as
development of donor specific
alloimmunity and consequential refractoriness to subsequent
platelet transfusions.
When successful, bone marrow transplantations are a potential cure
for the above
patients. In a non-malignant setting, eligible patients can receive
Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow transplant. Due to the absence of
neoplasia in
such patients, it is difficult to justify the toxic effects of
stringent conditioning regimens
that are otherwise beneficial in eradicating cancerous cells and
promoting engraftment.
Thus, many physicians choose to transplant under reduced intensity
conditions.
However, under these conditions, it is observed that chronically
transfused patients
reject the HLA-matched bone marrow transplant at higher rates than
minimally or un-
transfused patients. Because the transplants are HLA-matched or
-identical, it is
predicted that rejection is due to minor histocompatibility
antigens. Therefore, the goal
of the current dissertation is to test and characterize the role of
prior alloimmunization
against minor histocompatibility antigens, expressed by transfused
platelet units, in the
rejection of an MHC-identical, unrelated donor bone marrow
transplant. The data
presented herein demonstrate that minor histocompatibility
antigen reactive cellular
alloimmunity induced in response to allogeneic leukocyte reduced
platelet transfusions
can induce rejection of a subsequent MHC-matched bone marrow
transplant expressing
the target minor histocompatibility antigens under reduced
intensity conditions. To the
extent that the observed murine biology reflects human physiology,
these findings
additionally indicate potential clinical interventions to overcome
refractoriness to platelet
or red blood cell transfusions and rejection of an HLA-matched
transplant under
reduced intensity conditions in allogeneic platelet transfused
patients.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1 - Introduction --

Council and the Catechism of the Catholic Church endorse the
application of the historical-critical method to scripture, the
catechism's historicist interpretation of the Adamic stands in
tension with the broad consensus of current scholarship, and
underscores the necessity of a hermeneutics of suspicion in the
interpretation of magisterial formulations. I trace relations
between the magisterium and modern biblical scholarship, noting the
magisterium‘s endorsement of the historical-critical method
in Divino Afflante Spiritu (1943), a statement by the
Pontifical Biblical Commission in the Enchiridion Biblicum
(1954), Dei Verbum (1965), and the 1992 Catechism of the
Catholic Church # 109-112. I then assert the compatibility of
the historical-critical method with canonical exegesis, proposing
that the application of the historical-critical method can be
highly compatible with fidelity to the faith tradition. Next, I
take the Adamic myth as a case-study so as to compare, on the one
hand, the broad consensus of contemporary exegetes it in light of
the historical-critical method and, on the other, the manner in
which the 1992 catechism interprets the text. I propose that the
broad consensus of contemporary exegetes regards the Adamic
narrative as myth, fall account, etiology, and polemic but not as
the recollection, figurative or otherwise, of a particular
historical event. I note that Vatican Two‘s Gaudium et
Spes (1965) evokes the myth in a manner consistent with this
scholarly consensus, utilizing the term ""beginning"", with reference
to God rather than a historical beginning. In contrast, the
catechism‘s interpretation of the myth perpetuates the
historicist position of Humani Generis (1950), standing in
tension with broad scholarly consensus and with the
catechism‘s own endorsement of the historical-critical
method. I offer a hermeneutical critique of the catechism‘s
historicist position, drawing upon scholarly insights on the genre
of myth. Finally, I argue that the catechism‘s mode of
argumentation in defense of its historicist interpretation of the
Adamic myth, exhibits the characteristics of integralism, an
approach to Catholic doctrine that conflates magisterial
formulations with revelation itself and necessitates the
application of a hermeneutics of suspicion on the part of
catechists and learners.

Islands of Memory: The Sea Islands, Black Women Artists, and the
Promise of Home
By Folashadé Alao

This study examines the development and construction of the Sea
Islands as a
significant cultural landscape in the black imagination and
historicizes the processes
informing the Sea Islands' contemporary emergence as a site of
memory. The
coalescence of cultural and academic interests, the publication of
new research materials
on the Sea Islands, and the discovery and republication of old
works, such as Drums and
Shadows, during the 1970's enabled the Sea Islands to emerge in
the national black
imagination in new ways that black visual artists and writers would
illuminate. The
movement of Gullah culture into the mainstream and the elevation of
the Sea Islands as a
site of memory were aided particularly by literary, dramatic,
musical, and visual arts and
the sustained interests and creative expressions of different
groups of artists.
This study focuses on the particular visualizations of the Sea
Islands in Paule
Marshall's Praisesong for the Widow (1983), Gloria Naylor's
Mama Day (1988), and
Julie Dash's film Daughters of the Dust (1991) and novel
Daughters of the Dust (1997).
Specifically, I underscore the sources they draw upon to construct
their visions; the
voices, images, and histories they challenge; the functions they
hope such a vision will
hold for their readers; and their works' place within the Sea
Islands Cultural Renaissance
which surrounds their publication. Marshall, Naylor, and Dash's
works capture and
respond to a transforming relationship between African Americans
and their African
ancestry as well as to the southern landscape, both of which
resulted from the social and
political struggles of the 1960s and 1970s and a shift in black
migratory patterns in the
1970s. Marshall, Naylor, and Dash's works also reflect a renewed
critical study of
African American origins and genealogy, and the increasing concerns
surrounding the
transformations of black urban and rural life. The Sea Islands, in
these works, emerge as
a site of intersections, continuity, and reconnections with
southern homeplaces, distant
African memories, submerged oral histories, and neglected cultural
traditions.","Table of Contents -- Introduction -- 5 -- Chapter 1 -- ""A Sacred

Popular Glucose Tracking Apps and Use of mHealth by Latinos with
Diabetes","Background: Diabetes in the United States is a pervasive
chronic disease, contributing to hundreds of thousands of deaths
each year. Latinos in particular suffer from higher rates of
complications and diabetes-related mortality than non-Hispanic
Whites. mHealth is a promising new treatment modality for diabetes,
though few smartphone apps have been designed specifically for
Latinos.
Objectives: (1) To identify common features of popular
glucose tracking apps; (2) To determine the use of these apps among
a sample of online Hispanics in the U.S.
Methods: First, twenty popular diabetes apps were
reviewed to ascertain the most prevalent features and
functionalities. Second, an online survey was fielded through a
popular health website for Latinos inquiring about respondents' use
of diabetes apps.
Results:
App review: Approximately one-third of apps were
available in Spanish. The most common features were blood glucose
recording/annotation and activity logs. Most apps permitted
exportation of data via e-mail but only a third enabled uploading
to an online account. Twenty percent of apps could connect directly
with a glucometer, and 30% had reminder functionalities prompting
patients to take medications or check blood glucose levels.
Online survey: Over 1,600 surveys were completed. Over
90% of respondents were from the United States, including Puerto
Rico. The majority of respondents used a device running on an
Android platform while only a quarter used an iPhone. Use of
diabetes apps was approximately 3% among diabetics and 3.6% among
diabetics who also had a smartphone. Among app users, blood glucose
and medication diaries were the most frequently used
functionalities while hemoglobin A1c and insulin diaries were the
least used. The majority of app users did not share their progress
on social media though many of these were willing to share it with
their doctor.
Conclusions: Many Latinos do not possess the diabetes
knowledge or self-awareness to fully benefit from the most
prevalent functionalities offered by the most popular diabetes
apps. We recommend developers incorporate more basic features such
as diabetes education, reminder functionalities, Spanish language
interfaces, and glucometer connectivities.","Chapter I: Introduction -- Context of

Olympic Games","Abstract
Inside the Perimeter:
Urban Development in Atlanta since the 1996 Olympic Games
In the 1990s the population of the city of Atlanta grew for the
first time since the
early 1970s. Many of the newly arrived residents were white and
middle class and this
contrasted with the city's recent history which had been marked by
decades of white
flight and extreme class bifurcation. Far from a spontaneous
reversal, Atlanta's business
and political leaders had been working together for years to
counteract the pull of the
suburbs and attract middle class residents to the city. This
partnership has been called a
governing regime and it worked to take advantage of increasingly
global networks of
capital and people to create the thriving cosmopolitan city
Atlanta's leaders have
dreamed of since the Civil War.
This dissertation examines the changes that have taken place in
Atlanta's physical
and social landscape since the city hosted the Olympic Games in
1996 and places these
changes within their local, national and global historical context.
In addition to
examining the global economic situation within which these changes
took place and the
governing regime that steered the city through these networks, this
dissertation analyses
the development of a tourist infrastructure in Downtown, the
phenomenon of Intown
gentrification and the creation of a consumer driven ""live, work
and play"" neighborhood
called Atlantic Station.
The governing regime is characterized as pro-Third Way because it
defines the
role of local government as facilitator for private business. This
relationship has been
arguably successful in recreating parts of the city but it has
often done so at the expense
of those who are least able to take advantage of the market.
Whether it be from the
destruction of public housing, displacement due to gentrification
or increased antagonism
toward the homeless, the city's most vulnerable residents are

Engineering kinases for dual thymidine and thymidylate kinase
activity
By Yichen Liu
Thymidine kinase (TK) and thymidylate kinase (TMPK) are essential
enzymes
that function in the salvage pathway for synthesis of thymidine
triphosphate, a DNA
building block. Their importance also exists in activating
nucleoside analogs (NAs), an
important category of anti-cancer and anti-virus drugs. Because NAs
enter the cell as
prodrugs, they require three consecutive phosphorylation steps
catalyzed by cellular
kinases in the salvage pathway to become biologically active and
halt DNA synthesis.
Among the cellular kinases responsible for NA activation, the first
two
phosphorylation steps usually present the bottleneck because of
their poor activity
towards NA. Previous engineering efforts to alter and improve
specificity of these
kinases have largely focused on the first step of phosphorylation
catalyzed by
deoxyribonucleoside kinase (dNK). However, such approach bears the
real risk of simply
shifting the bottleneck from the improved first to the second
phosphorylation reaction. A
more promising strategy is to eliminate both bottleneck steps by
creating a dual
functioning enzyme that can convert NAs directly to their
corresponding diphosphate
form. In this dissertation, I developed a conditional auxotroph E.
coli strain for the
selection of dual TK and TMPK activity. As the first selection
system reported for
selecting two consecutive reactions, this auxotroph strain enables
the evaluation of
combinatorial kinase libraries for TK and TMPK activities both
independently and
concurrently. Employing the dual-function auxotroph strain, I have
evaluated chimera
libraries of dNK from Drosophila melanogaster and TMPK from
Thermotoga maritima
using the non-homologous recombination technique SCRATCHY in
combination with
the computational method SCHEMA. Separately, more fundamental
questions
concerning the mechanistic similarities and differences between
these two enzymatic
reactions were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and ITC
studies of substrate
binding. Experiments were conducted on DmdNK and TmTMPK, which
excusively
catalyze the first or second phosphorylation reaction, as well as
the only know dual-
function TK from herpes simplex virus (HSV). The information
extracted from these
experiments provides new insights regarding the dual function of
HSV1-TK and will
guide future engineering experiments.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1 General introduction.

The Proof that History Forgot: Samuel Clarke's Cosmological
Argument
In his work, A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of
God, Samuel Clarke presents
what he considers a single cohesive cosmological argument for God's
existence. Closer analysis
of his argument reveals three distinct arguments, however, each of
which is dependent upon
three concepts that distinguish Clarke from other modern writers.
These concepts include: the
principle of sufficient reason, his unique notion of a necessary
being, and his framing the
argument in terms of Newtonian natural philosophy. Clarke's
argument represents, in many
ways, a reconciliation of early modern science and natural
theology. Clarke brings to the
traditional cosmological argument a keen logical insight and an in
depth understanding of
Newtonian natural philosophy, the result of which is the strongest
and most articulate
formulation of the argument in the early modern period. Not only
does Clarke's argument make
clear the cosmological arguments dependence upon the principle of
sufficient reason and the
conception of a necessary being, but also its use of Newtonian
natural philosophy represents a
tour de force against early modern naturalistic explanations for
the origin of the universe.
Clarke's distinctive views on these topics become evident through
an analysis of his argument,
and an evaluation of the argument in light of its greatest critic,
David Hume.

transferrin
receptor levels in non-pregnant women of Papua-New-Guinea
Background:
Iron deficiency anemia is a global threat especially in
the
third world countries and is associated with significant morbidity
and
mortality. Transferrin receptor (TfR) levels are indicators of iron
depletion
and can detect low iron levels before clinical anemia sets in.
Inflammation
and acute phase reaction are associated with iron deficiency and
anemic
status, thus it is instructive to assess the relationship between
transferrin
receptor levels and markers of inflammation and acute phase
reaction
such as AGP and CRP.

Objective: This study aims to determine if there is an
association between
elevation of the acute phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and
α1-acid
glycoprotein (AGP) and elevated transferrin receptor levels (TfR),
in
Papua New Guinean non-pregnant women 15-49 years of age who
participated in the 2005 Papua New Guinea National
Micronutrient
Survey.

Methods: The 2005 Papua New Guinea National Micronutrient
Survey
was a stratified PPS survey with a 2-stage cluster design. Data on
866
non-pregnant women 15-49 years of age were used in the
analysis.
Logistic regression models accounting for complex samples design
were
used to assess the relationship between elevated AGP and elevated
TfR
status and between elevated CRP and elevated TfR status.

Results: The overall prevalence of elevated TfR was 20.6%
in the study
population. The prevalence of elevated CRP and elevated AGP was
9.0%
and 7.4%, respectively. Both CRP and AGP were significantly
associated
with TfR in Papua New Guinean non-pregnant women aged 15-49
years.
For CRP,there seemed to be a weak association between CRP and TfR
in
urban areas compared to rural areas where this association is very
strong.
For AGP, OR=3.38 (95% CI: 1.51,7.54) controlling for the
confounders
and significant groups.
Conclusions: This study suggests that there is a
significant relationship
between acute phase reactants AGP and CRP and indicator of
iron
depletion status TfR and that the former should be part of all
nutrition
surveys to identify iron depletion. Future studies should explore
the
relationship under different environments and at different cutoff

in-vitro and in-vivo studies.","Mounting data suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines may play a
role in
the development of depression in humans, especially in individuals
who are non-
responsive to conventional antidepressant strategies. Nuclear
factor κ B (NF-κB),
a lynchpin in the inflammatory response, plays a key role in
transmitting cytokine
signals to the brain and the release of central pro-inflammatory
cytokines, which
in turn have been shown to induce depressive-like behaviors in
laboratory
animals and humans. Data indicate that curcumin, a natural
ingredient of the
curry spice turmeric, acts as a NF-κB inhibitor and exhibits
anti-inflammatory and
anti-cancer properties. Curcumin analogues with enhanced activity
on the NF-κB
pathway have been developed including EF31 and UBS109 whose potency
for
NF-κB inhibition has yet to be determined.
The anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds on the NF-κB
pathway
were explored in-vitro in mouse RAW264.7 using lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), a
potent inflammatory stimulus. Compared to curcumin, EF31 and
UBS109
exhibited significantly more potent inhibition of LPS-induced
NF-κB pathway
activity, including IκB kinase β activity, NF-κB
DNA-binding activity, and the
induction of downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein.
Curcumin
analogues also demonstrated potent toxicity in NF-κB-dependent
cancer cell
lines while having minimal and reversible toxicity in RAW264.7
macrophages.
To examine the effects of curcumin analogs in-vivo, a model of
LPS-
induced immune and behavioral alterations was developed using
C57BL/6 mice.
Treatment with LPS induced a bi-phasic behavioral response
characterized by
sickness behaviors at 6 hours followed by depressive-like behaviors
at 24 hours.
Moreover, NF-κB DNA-binding activity peaked early in the
spleen and brain,
while expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain
corresponded with
the expression of sickness and depressive-like behaviors at 6 and
24. Although
curcumin analogs showed potent NF-κB inhibition in-vitro,
neither reliably
reduced LPS-induced NF-κB DNA-binding activity or cytokine
mRNA expression
in the periphery or brain.
Taken together, these data suggest that EF31 and UBS109 are
potent
inhibitors of NF-κB in-vitro, although modifications to the
treatment paradigm in-
vivo may be necessary to achieve inhibition of NF-κB, reduce
inflammation, and
consequently block LPS-induced behavioral alterations. Thus, both
EF31 and
UBS109 represent promising curcumin analogues for further
therapeutic
development.","Chapter 1. Background: depression, inflammation, and the role of

Youth sexual and reproductive health in Bosnia and
Herzegovina:
Informing intervention strategies using quantitative methods
by Glen R. Abedi
Youth sexual and reproductive health represents an area of
healthcare that is in particular need of
development in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, little research on this
subject has been conducted to date
to guide policy and programming. CARE Northwest Balkans, a regional
subsidiary of CARE
International, completed a quantitative survey on youth sexual and
reproductive health in Bosnia-
Herzegovina in 2006. Respondents consisted(Mann, Drucker,
Tarantola, &amp; McCabe, 1994) of university
students above the age of 18. They answered questions about their
behaviors and attitudes associated with
sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and related behaviors.
The largest ethnic group represented in the sample was Serbs
(71.56%), followed by Bosniaks
(23.85%). The median age of respondents was 22.21 years. Only 5.50%
of respondents reported ever
having been tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI)
although 69.72% reported having engaged in
sexual intercourse in the previous year. The most popular sources
of information on sexual and
reproductive health were TV &amp; radio, printed materials, and
school. The effectiveness of these sources of
information as avenues for public health communications remains
unclear.

Cultivating Our Conversation:
The Christian Practice of Nonviolent Discourse in the Public
Square
By Jason G. Williamson
Christian discourse in the public square in America today needs to
be
changed. This paper proposes that the practice of nonviolent
discourse is
necessary when Christians engage in the public square. The
historical
Augustinian dualism that leads to a divisive attitude of ""us"" vs.
""them"" must be
rejected in favor of an inclusive manner of engagement. When
speaking publicly,
Christians should replace moral certitude with theological humility
and allow an
agapic ethic to inform their speech. In this way, nonviolent
discourse represents
a living faith that authentically reflects Jesus' commands to love
one another.
Jubilee Partners, an intentional Christian community, provides an
example of
this type of public nonviolent discourse.

Reconciliation for the Korean Church in the Conflict between
""Comfort Women"" and Japanese Government","There is ongoing conflict between ""comfort women"", who were
exploited as a sexual slavery by Japan during World War II, and
present Japanese government; this conflict has been sustained by
Japanese government's official denial of sexual slavery during the
war time. My thesis aims at resolving this ongoing conflict between
two parties in terms of the language of reconciliation from my
reflection and reconstruction of 1) Christian theology and ethics
and 2) circumstances in other contexts over the world. I
particularly focus on an agency of the Korean church in the process
of reconciliation.
In the first and second chapter, I intend to suggest a sound theory
of reconciliation in light of a compatible relation between agape
and justice in the age of peace-building. Nurturing agape
transforms justice from liberal justice - mere fairness and strict
punishment - to restorative justice - restoring the right
relationship. Restorative justice is the indispensable part of
agape, and it also prevents agape from lapsing into injustice. Both
nurturing agape and restorative justice shared a moral vision of
restoration of the right relationship - bringing down the dividing
of walls of hostility in the world of injustice and violence. In
the third chapter, I try to persuade the Korean church to become an
agent of reconciliation between ""comfort women"" and the Japanese
government. I explored the richness of Christian languages of
reconciliation in Christian tradition: 1) the Christology and
Ecclesiology of Barth and Bonhoeffer and 2) the Pauline theology
interpreted by Volf and Lederach.
In the rest of chapters I intend to develop possible practices of
the Korean church in order to facilitate the process of
reconciliation between ""comfort women"" and Japanese government. In
the fourth chapter, I first explored the social context and
location of ""comfort women"" by borrowing a Korean ethos, Han -
suppressed pain from injustice or oppression. In the fifth and
sixth chapters I suggested four practices of the Korean church -
acknowledgement, reparations, apology, and forgiveness - for
healing wounds of ""comfort women"" and restoring the right
relationship between them and the Korean church, Korean society,
and Japanese government.","TABLE OF CONTENT -- INTRODUCTION 1 -- SECTION I: A THEORY OF

Approach","The goal of the current study was to examine associations between
multiple behavioral and biological systems of emotion regulation
over the course of infancy and the role of maternal depressive
symptoms in predicting these associations. Participants were women
with a history of depression and/or anxiety and their infants (n =
242). Women were recruited during pregnancy and their depressive
symptoms were measured repeatedly throughout pregnancy and the
postpartum. Infant behavioral (temperament, observed affect) and
biological (EEG, RSA, cortisol) measures were collected at 3-, 6-,
and 12-months of age, and mothers' concurrent depressive symptoms
were also measured. Infant baseline RSA and resting cortisol did
not significantly interact to predict infant observed negative
affect concurrently or prospectively; however, there was a
significant main effect for cortisol at 6 months predicting
observed negative affect at 12 months. In addition, infants
clustered into different emotion regulation profiles based on
biology and behavior at 3-, 6-, and 12-months of age, and maternal
perinatal depressive symptoms differentially predicted membership
in these profiles. Findings highlight the importance of exploring
how biological and behavioral domains of emotion regulation relate
over the course of infancy and may be associated with depressive
symptomatology in mothers. Future research should consider indices
of biological responsivity to stressors in addition to baseline or
resting measures, as well as how these multiple indices together
may predict the development of psychopathology.","Table of Contents

Humans, Animals, and the Image of God: An Examination of
Difference in Kind
and Difference of Degree Arguments for Human Uniqueness and
Superiority
Image of God language from the Genesis 1 account of creation has
often been
used to justify human superiority over nature. A significant
problem with this
approach is that the text does not identify what it means to be
created imago dei
and throughout history the God-­‐like characteristic
associated with humans has
changed. This paper is an examination of the historical and
traditional uses of
image of God language along with modern reinterpretations of
these
perspectives that use both difference in kind and difference of
degree
arguments. In addition, this paper examines how claims for human
superiority
are undermined in light of modern scientific advances in biology,
ethology, and
archaeology and whether or not image of God language should be used
in or is
helpful for religious discourse in the present day.","Table of Contents -- I. -- An Image Problem -- 1 -- II. -- Church

Refugee Students in Global Schools, Constructing Citizenship:
A comparative case study of sixth grade classrooms in two public IB
schools
Although the United States resettles more refugee students than any
other country, little research
examines the ways that schools in the United States prepare these
students to participate in their
political community. At the same time, a growing number of schools
serving refugee students are
adopting curricula with a global focus. The purpose of this
research was to conduct a
comparative case study of schooling for sixth-grade refugee
students at two publicly-funded
schools that serve many refugee students and emphasize global
education. In this research, I
addressed the following questions: 1) How does the implemented
curriculum, including content,
pedagogy, and climate, educate students for citizenship? 2) What
are students taught about
different levels of affinity (community, national, global, and
transnational citizenship)? 3) What
are students taught about citizenship as a status, practice, and
feeling? 4) How are citizenship,
literacy, and the use of English connected within these classrooms?
5) What does citizenship
mean to refugee youth in these schools? This study drew on data
from classroom observations,
interviews with teachers and administrators, and focus groups with
students to create descriptive
profiles of classrooms and schools, allowing for comparisons
between the two schools in the
study. At one school, content was both multicultural and
comparative; pedagogy included
students making connections between the content, themselves, and
other students; and both
teachers and students expressed feeling ""at home"" in the school.
The discourse in social studies
class focused on comparative national practice, and the teacher and
teaching assistant
encouraged students' development of transnational identities. At
the other school, content,
pedagogy, and climate varied among specific settings. School-wide
activities involved global
content and endorsed global citizenship as characterized by
practice, but did not incorporate
refugee students' perspectives. In social studies class, although
students learned about different
countries, the teacher continually emphasized the perspective of
""us Americans"" and taught
through lecture. In this classroom, both the teacher and students
expressed disrespect. In
language arts class, students learned about multicultural issues,
drew connections between
themselves and the content, and worked in a responsive classroom
climate. Within the ESOL
class, students learned about some nationally-focused citizenship
content, and for the most part
only interacted with students from the same cultural background.
Overall, findings from this
study suggest that although schools can educate students for
inclusive citizenship, global
education initiatives do not always translate into classroom
pedagogy that is responsive to the
needs of refugee students. This work builds on the literature,
suggesting that international
education can be responsive or exclusive, and that practices vary
at the school and classroom
levels. I argue that schools working with refugee students should
consider how they
institutionalize the dimensions of care as they implement a global
curriculum.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Statement of the Problem

HIV Prevention Research for Men Who Have Sex with Men:
Meta-Analysis, Intraclass
Correlation, and Transformation Between Count and Dichotomous
Outcomes
By Wayne D. Johnson, Jr.
This dissertation describes three methodological and content-based
studies related
to meta-analysis of HIV prevention research for men who have sex
with men (MSM).
First, we compared ANOVA models for individually- and
group-randomized trials to
derive the factors necessary to account for intraclass correlation
(ICC) in three classic
designs. For the simplest design, the factor is (n - 1)
VIF / (n - VIF) where n is the
number of participants per condition and VIF is the
variance inflation factor1+(m - 1)ICC.
Simulations confirmed our correction factors for both additive and
multiplicative models.
Second, we used regression and the method of moments to identify
candidate
formulas for transformation between proportions (summarizing
dichotomous data), and
means and variances (summarizing count data). Best empirical
results were obtained
from regression models predicting the proportions as a function of
the mean and variance
(and vice versa), or by the method of moments assuming a negative
binomial distribution.
Third, we applied these results in a meta-analysis of behavioral
HIV prevention
for MSM. We found 54 interventions with 16,224 participants. The 38
interventions that
were compared to minimal or no HIV prevention controls reduced
unprotected sex by
27% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15% to 37%). The other 16
interventions reduced
unprotected sex by 17% compared to standard or other HIV prevention
interventions (CI
= 5% to 27%). Our methodological work permitted a robust conclusion
that behavioral
prevention reduces self-reported unprotected sex among
MSM.

Information Systems Data Sharing and Use","Objective: To determine and characterize practices regarding
data sharing and usage (particularly for research purposes) in
Immunization Information Systems (IIS), as well as barriers to
using such data.
Methods: We surveyed immunization program managers (IPMs)
associated with all 64 CDC grantee immunization programs between
July and September, 2012.
Results: Over 95% of IPMs responded (61/64). The top two
barriers reported by IPMs to using IIS data for research were
insufficient time and too few employees, irrespective of whether or
not the jurisdiction reported using data for research purposes.
IPMs who agreed with the statement ""research is part of the mission
of an immunization program"" were more likely to report using data
for research (p=0.045). Among those who responded, the most common
kind of IIS research conducted involved determinants of vaccination
coverage (N=24/26, 92%). A greater percentage of IPMs in
jurisdictions that reported using IIS data for research reported
having data sharing agreements in place. Immunization programs that
have used IIS data for research were more likely to report online
IIS provider enrollment, integration with insurance company
records, and integration with hospital records. Alternatively,
immunization programs that did not report using IIS data for
research were more likely to have IIS with modules addressing
topics such as adverse event reporting, smallpox, and first
responder vaccination.
Conclusion: Staff size and time were the two most cited barriers
to conducting research with IIS data. Therefore, focus should also
be placed on providing immunization programs with the resources
needed to conduct such research.","Contents -- Chapter I: Background/Literature Review

Counseling and Testing Counselors in Copperbelt Province,
Zambia","With the expansion of couples' voluntary HIV counseling and
testing (CVCT) in urban Zambia, there has been a growing need to
evaluate CVCT trainings to ensure that couples are receiving
quality counseling and care. Zambia-Emory HIV Research Project
(ZEHRP) has been providing CVCT counseling, laboratory testing, and
data management trainings in the Copperbelt Province since 2008.
The objective of this study was to answer two questions regarding
the CVCT trainings held by ZEHRP: (1) Were the training programs
successful in improving knowledge of relevant facts and procedures?
(2) Was the knowledge among non-medical ""lay"" counselors comparable
to that of medically trained counselors before and after the
trainings? This study evaluated 1,283 counselors, rapid HIV testing
staff (""laboratory""), and data managers. Each of the trainings was
quantitatively measured in a pre-post test design based mainly on
true/false questions. The tests covered topics including the cause
of HIV infection, modes of transmission, the basics of couples'
counseling, and the counseling of discordant results. Following
training, the overall average score increased from 68.8% at
baseline to 83.8% (p &lt; 0.001). Average scores across
covariates, including years of experience, education, and medical
background also resulted in statistically significant improvement
during the post-test (p &lt; 0.001). 98.4% of data
management and laboratory testing trainees passed their
post-training test with at least an 80%. In contrast, the average
post-training score for counselor trainees was below 80% in some
groups including men, those over the age of 50, those trained
before 2011, and those with less than a college education or a
non-medical background. Counselors in two of the four cities had
average post training scores greater than 80%. Most of these
factors remained predictive of post-test scores in multivariate
analyses, with significant interactions occurring between several
variables. Systematic pre and post-test assessments are critical to
ensure quality services and to highlight training components that
must be repeated until passing scores are achieved, particularly as
task-shifting from medical to lay staff becomes more common.","--  --

A Practical Theology-Based Analysis of

by Arthi Devarajan
This dissertation analyzes pedagogies of classical South Indian
dance in the
United States, to determine the ways that pedagogical practices
create and inform
theology, social organization, and religious and cultural identity
for participating dance
communities. The primary theoretical framework guiding the research
of this dissertation
comes from practical theology - namely, the study of religious
practices as living,
prescriptive negotiations of communal value. The dissertation
features ethnographic
research at three field sites: the Natyanjali School of Dance (a
suburban, primarily South
Indian community in Andover, MA), the Fine Arts Society
Natya-Adhyayana-Gurukulam
(a residential summer camp in rural Virginia focused on Bharata
Natyam, a classical
South Indian genre of dance), and the Triveni School of Dance (an
urban, ethnically
diverse community of dancers in Boston). Through performance
analysis and the study
of dancers' narratives, I explore how embodied practice, discursive
exchange, social
organization, performance, and imagination combine to form
frameworks of religious and
ethical knowledge in these communities. I conclude that through
teaching and learning
dance, communities of dancers negotiate a practical theology -
social values and
hierarchy, ethics, and religious identity - particular to the
American Hindu diaspora.
Dance, in this context, creates a matrix of social and ethical
principles informed by bodily
practice, experience, and imagination, as well as traditional
sources of Hindu religious
authority such as religious narrative, ritual, sacred image, and
canonical scripture.","Chapter 1.

Love","This dissertation is a constructive theological project
that lays out structures of the human condition that dispose
humanity to vulnerability, suffering, and redemption. In this sense
it participates in the methods of both fundamental and liberation
theologies. I argue that the human condition is essentially
vulnerable; that there is a dynamic, causal relationship between
vulnerability, anxiety, and violence; and that divine love offers
human beings existential and practical resources for redemption,
experienced as resilience and resistance.
The project is divided into two parts. The first half of the
dissertation is an analysis of human vulnerability and its
relationship with anxiety, egocentrism, privilege, and violence.
Here I posit that the fundamental dimensions of human life that
make created existence and happiness possible also threaten the
human telos by exposing us to pain and suffering. The
anxiety surrounding suffering often causes human beings to
collectively mismanage vulnerability in systems of privilege, which
exacerbates the problem of vulnerability and leads to greater
anxiety and violence. This analysis of the human condition lays the
foundation for the theological heart of the dissertation, in which
I argue that divine love responds to vulnerability by empowering
human beings with resources needed for resilience in the face of
harm and resistance to violence and oppression. This redemptive
power of divine love has a Trinitarian structure to it, offering 1)
the invulnerable power of preservative love, 2) the
power-in-vulnerability of solidarity with the human condition, and
3) empowerment for creative transformation in the Spirit of holy
longing for abundant life. The project concludes with an analysis
of three practices that have the potential to nurture the growth of
divine love in Christians, and human beings in general: dangerous
memory of suffering, contemplative kenosis, and solidarity.
Throughout the dissertation, my argument is informed by women's
diverse and multi-faceted experiences of maternity and natality. I
place maternal narratives and practices in mutually critical
conversation with Scripture, historical theology, feminist
theology, philosophy, and ethics. Drawing on these sources, my
constructive proposal suggests that vulnerability is both the site
of our deepest wounds and the condition for the possibility of
experiencing redemption.",

MONOCYTE ACTIVATION AND DIFFERENTIATION AND DURING ACUTE STRESS IN
PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION","Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and release of
catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (NE), regulate inflammation
through interactions with the innate immune system. Although
crosstalk between these two systems is clear, the role of NE in
mediating inflammatory responses is less clear, with evidence of
both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. To further understand
these paradoxical effects of NE, we examined the impact of cellular
activation and differentiation on inflammatory cytokine production
after NE administration to a human monocyte cell line. Using
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cellular activation, we showed
that NE inhibits interleukin (IL)-6 protein release from the
monocytic form of the cell, when administered before LPS. However,
treating the cells with NE after LPS-induced activation led to a
decrease in NE's inhibitory effects. NE inhibition of LPS-induced
IL-6 was shown to be mediated by the beta 2-adrenergic receptor
(B2-AR) as well as cAMP. Interestingly, the decreased sensitivity
to NE following monocyte activation by LPS was found to be mediated
by a PKA-dependent decrease in B2-AR mRNA. Indeed, blocking PKA
reversed B2-AR mRNA downregulation and restored cell sensitivity to
NE. Differentiation of cells from the monocyte state to the
macrophage state also resulted in decreased NE sensitivity, likely
a result of increased mRNA expression of beta arrestin-2 (BARR-2),
which can lead to B2-AR desensitization. Finally, LPS-induced
activation of cells in the macrophage state completely abolished
NE's anti-inflammatory effects, in association with both decreased
B2-AR mRNA as well as decreased mRNA for BARR-2, which can inhibit
inflammatory responses. To study the impact of NE on inflammation
in vivo, we examined stress-induced NE and IL-6 release in patients
with major depression versus healthy controls. We found that
patients with depression exhibited reduced sensitivity to NE, as
depressed patients with high NE responses to stress exhibited the
highest stress-induced IL-6 responses. Taken together, these
studies indicate that NE primarily functions to inhibit
inflammation. However, the extent of NE's anti-inflammatory action

Abstract
Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Postoperative Mortality Following
Congenital Heart
Surgery
By Matthew E. Oster
Objectives: This study assessed racial/ethnic disparities in
postoperative mortality following
surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) and explored whether
disparities persist after
adjusting for access to care.
Study Design: We used the Pediatric Health Information
System database to perform a
retrospective cohort study of 44,017 patients with 49,833 CHD
surgery encounters in 2004-2008
at 41 children's hospitals. We used chi-square analysis to compare
unadjusted mortality rates by
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic)
and constructed Poisson
regression models to determine adjusted mortality risk ratios (RRs)
and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs).
Results: In-hospital postoperative mortality rate was 3.4%;
non-Hispanic whites had the lowest
mortality rate (2.8%), followed by non-Hispanic blacks (3.6%) and
Hispanics (3.9%) (p&lt;0.0001).
After adjusting for age, sex, genetic syndrome, and surgery risk
category, the RR of death was
1.32 for non-Hispanic blacks (CI 1.14-1.52) and 1.21 for Hispanics
(CI 1.07-1.37), both
compared with non-Hispanic whites. After adjusting for access to
care (insurance type and
hospital of surgery), these estimates did not appreciably change
(non-Hispanic blacks: RR=1.27,
CI 1.09-1.47; Hispanics: RR=1.22, CI 1.05-1.41).
Conclusion: There are notable racial/ethnic disparities in
postoperative mortality following CHD
surgery that do not appear to be explained by differences in access
to care.",

How Stasi Silenced the Streets: The Protests of the 2003-2004
French Headscarf Affair
By Felicia C. Goodman
On March 15, 2004, the French government issued a ban on the
wearing of
conspicuous symbols of religious affiliation in public elementary,
middle, and high
schools. This thesis traces the evolution of this so-called
""headscarf ban"" from April
2003 through March 2004. Special attention is given to the work of
the Stasi
Commission, set up by President Jacques Chirac to investigate and
reevaluate the status
of laïcité, or French secularism, across the
society. The Stasi Commission was
particularly important in rallying public opinion to favor the idea
of a law by December
2003, when Chirac announced his intentions to the nation. While the
majority of the
French supported the President, others voiced their objection to a
law in the streets of
Paris on the three major days of protest against the law--December
21, 2003, January 17,
2004, and February 14, 2004. This thesis positions these three
strikes as powerful
moments of disapproval, but also demonstrates how the prior
workings of the Stasi
Commission, and the growing tension between French secularism and
Islamic
fundamentalism, ultimately silenced the streets.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS iii -- INTRODUCTION: A French Foot in an Islamic

Burnt Norton - A Music Video
With ""Burnt Norton"" I have completed the first ever music video
honors thesis at
Emory University. While a film thesis of original content has been
made before, never has
the medium of the music video been attempted or fully explored
within the program.
Including writing, performing, and recording original music, I also
directed, produced, and
edited this thirteen minute long film from my own original script.
While there are various
types of music videos, my video is of the long-­‐form
variety, in which a connected story
plays out over three different songs. Thus the video works as both
a short narrative, and an
aesthetic and formal exploration of the music video format.
In the accompanying paper I not only critically explore and analyze
my own piece of
work, but also the influences and background of how the film came
to be. Principally, this
takes shape in studying the works and style of music video director
Spike Jonze. In his
continuing use of both the absurd and the nostalgic, Jonze served
as a major inspiration to
my own video. As such, ""Burnt Norton"" includes absurdist images
with an underlying
theme of nostalgia and the relation of time. By incorporating the
reflection on Spike Jonze
within my own video's analysis, I not only examine the importance
of Jonze's influence to
my film, but also consider what makes the music video a distinct
and creative medium full
of potential and artistic merit.","Table of Contents -- A Critical Study of Spike

The Association of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory
Medications and Carotid Artery Intima-media Thickness in Male
Veteran Twins
By Chao Song
Objective: NSAID use is common and may
increase cardiovascular risk through vascular mechanisms. We
studied the relationship between NSAID use and carotid IMT in a
sample of middle-aged veteran twins.
Methods: We studied 318 middle-aged
male twins (159 pairs) aged 47-60 years were recruited from the
Vietnam Era Twin Registry for the study. Common carotid artery
intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured using high resolution
B-mode ultrasonography. Generalized estimating equation (GEE)
models to adjust for possible confounding.
Results: The twins who took NSAIDs, on
average, had a 17.8 Âµm greater carotid IMT than his twin
who did not use NSAID (95% CI -4.5-40.0; monozygotic: 9.8, 95% CI
-9.8-29.4; dizygotic 95.9, 95% CI: 59.8-132.0). Compared with twins
who used aspirin, twins who non-aspirin NSAIDs had more
significantly greater carotid IMT. The carotid IMT of twins who
used non-aspirin NSAIDs was, on average, 31.7 Âµm higher
than carotid IMT for his twin brother who did not (95% CI 1.7-62.7;
monozygotic: 37.3, 95% CI 7.4-67.2; dizygotic 102.3, 95% CI:
56.3-148.3), while the carotid IMT of twins who used aspirin was,
on average, 10.3 Âµm higher than carotid IMT for his twin
brother who did not (95% CI -15.4-35.9; monozygotic: -7.0, 95% CI
-32.4-18.4; dizygotic 93.2, 95% CI: 48.9-137.6).
Conclusion: Among middle-aged Vietnam
era veterans, NSAID use was associated with carotid intima-media
thickness. This suggests that NSAIDS may increase CVD risk through
vascular mechanisms. These findings may help future efforts to
evaluate and treat NSAID-related cardiovascular effects.

Predictor of Complementary Medicine Use among Adults: Findings from
the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)","Background: Attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic mental disorder that
affects 4.3%-4.7% of adults in the U.S. While first-line stimulant
medication treatments have short-term benefits, long-term health
outcomes are unclear and many adults do not adhere tostimulant
medications over time. Complementary medicines, on the other hand,
have been found to be used by adults with mental disorders more
often than the general population. Objectives: The current
study aims to measure national estimates of adult ADHD and their
rates of specific, lifetime complementary medicine use. In
addition, it aims to test ADHD as a predictor of complementary
medicine use, adjusting for socio-demographic variables and
depression, anxiety, and insomnia in the last 12 months.
Methods: Data was analyzed from 2007 National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset, including prevalence estimates of
socio-demographics, mental illness, and complementary medicine use.
A binary block regression model was employed in order to test the
predictive affects of ADHD status on complementary medicine use.
Results: Among the 2.9% of adults who reported lifetime
ADHD, 68.7% reported any lifetime complementary medicine use.
Adults with ADHD were significantly more likely to use any
complementary medicine in their lifetime as well as 23 out of 36
specific complementary therapies, compared to adults without ADHD.
ADHD was found to be a significant predictor of lifetime
complementary medicine use, after adjusting for socio-demographic
variables and depression, anxiety, and insomnia in the last 12
months; the odds of using complementary medicine was 1.68 times
greater among adults with ADHD compared to adults without ADHD.
Conclusions: Adults with ADHD were more likely to use
complementary medicine in their lifetime compared to adults without
ADHD. Adults with ADHD were significantly more likely to report
co-morbid depression, anxiety, and insomnia compared to adults
without ADHD. Lastly, ADHD was a significant predictor of
complementary medicine use. Future research should replicate the
current findings using clinical measures of mental illness and
explore motivations for complementary medicine use among adults
with ADHD in order to better determine treatment seeking behavior
among the ADHD population.","--  -- Introduction (1) --

Influences of Household Storage on E. coli
Concentration in Drinking Water in
Northern, Coastal Ecuador
By Katharine Robb
Background: Recontamination of stored drinking water is a
known issue. However, a
study by Levy et al. (2008) observed significant attenuation
of E. coli concentrations
during storage. The observed attenuation could be due to organisms
settling to the
bottom of storage containers or die-off. Viable organisms that
settle could become re-
suspended, consumed and cause disease. Die-off, however, signifies
loss of infectivity.
Purpose: We examine: (1) changes in E. coli
concentration during storage of untreated
water under household and control conditions, (2) the impact of
agitation of containers
on E. coli concentrations, in order to understand whether
previously observed
reductions were due to settling or die-off, (3) the impact of
chlorination on the results
observed in aims (1) and (2), and (4) the extent of in-home E.
coli contamination.
Methods: We quantify changes in contamination during
storage, considering household
and source water characteristics and controlling for source
contamination, utilizing
microbiological/physicochemical data and household surveys. Source
water was stored
under household and control conditions and containers were
re-sampled after 24 hours
before and after agitation to determine how E. coli
concentration changed and if settling
occurred. Results: Without treatment, significant log
reduction in E. coli concentration
was observed under control, but not household conditions.
Differences between pre-
and post-agitation samples were observed under household but not
control conditions,
suggesting that settling of viable bacteria occurs under household
conditions whereas
die-off occurs under control conditions. This may be attributable
to biofilms and in-
home contamination of household containers. With chlorine
treatment, significant log
reduction of contamination was observed under both household and
control conditions.
Differences between pre- and post-agitation samples were observed
under control but
not household conditions, suggesting die-off of bacteria under
household conditions but
settling under control conditions. The opposite trend observed with
chlorine treatment
may be explained by the interaction of chlorine and turbidity.
Conclusion: Die-off and
settling of E. coli during storage was influenced by storage
conditions (household or
control), turbidity and initial source contamination. Significant
differences between pre-
and post-agitation samples suggest the need for standardized
sampling protocols that
call for the agitation of water storage containers.
RESUMEN

Las Influencias de Almacenamiento Domestico en la
Concentración de E. coli en el
Agua Potable en la Costa de Ecuador
Por Katharine Robb

Antecedentes: La re-contaminación del agua potable
almacenada es un problema
conocido. Sin embargo, un estudio realizado por Levy et al.
(2008) observó la atenuación
significativa de las concentraciones de E. coli durante el
almacenamiento. La atenuación
observada podría deberse a las bacterias depositándose en
el fondo de los recipientes
de almacenamiento o la mortandad de las bacterias. Bacterias
viables que se depositan
podrían convertirse nuevamente en suspensión donde
podrían ser consumidas y causar
enfermedades. Mortandad, sin embargo, significa la pérdida de
infectividad. Objetivo:
Examinamos: (1) cambios en la concentración de E. coli
durante el almacenamiento de
agua bajo condiciones del hogar y del control, (2) el impacto de la
agitación de los
recipientes en las concentraciones de E. coli, con el fin de
entender si las reducciones
observadas previamente se explican por deposición o mortandad,
(3) el impacto de la
cloración en los resultados observados en los objetivos (1) y
(2), y (4) el alcance de
contaminación del agua en la casa. Métodos:
Cuantificamos los cambios en la
contaminación durante el almacenamiento, teniendo en cuenta
las características de los
hogares y de las fuentes de agua. Utilizamos datos
microbiológicos / físico-químicos y
las encuestas de hogares. El agua de la fuente se almacena en las
condiciones del hogar
y del control. De los recipientes se tomaron muestras después
de 24 horas, antes y
después de la agitación para determinar si la
concentración de E. coli cambió y si la
deposición ocurrió. Resultados: Sin tratamiento,
la reducción significativa de la
concentración de E. coli fue observada bajo condiciones
de control, pero no bajo las
condiciones del hogar. Las diferencias entre las muestras tomadas
antes y después de
agitación se observaron en los hogares, pero no las
condiciones de control, lo que
sugiere que la deposición de bacterias viables se produce en
condiciones del hogar,
mientras que la mortandad se produce bajo condiciones de control.
Esto puede
atribuirse a las bio-membranas y a la contaminación en el
hogar de los recipientes
domésticos. Con el tratamiento con cloro, se observó una
reducción significativa en
ambas condiciones del hogar y del control. Las diferencias entre
las muestras tomadas
antes y después de la agitación se observaron bajo
control, pero no en las condiciones
del hogar, lo que sugiere mortandad de bacterias en las condiciones
del hogar, pero la
deposición bajo condiciones de control. La tendencia opuesta
observada con el
tratamiento con cloro puede explicarse debido a la interacción
del cloro y turbidez.
Conclusión: La mortandad y deposición de E.
coli durante el almacenamiento fueron
influidas por las condiciones de almacenamiento (hogar o control),
la turbidez y la
contaminación de la fuente inicial. Las diferencias
significativas entre las muestras
tomadas antes y después de agitación sugieren la
necesidad de estandarizar los
protocolos de muestreo que requieren la agitación de los
recipientes de
almacenamiento de agua.",TABLE OF CONTENTS

Racial Disparities in Receipt of Lung Cancer Treatment in
Southwest Georgia

Background: Previous studies have revealed existing racial
disparities in the receipt of
treatment among different groups of lung cancer patients in large
urban settings. This study
aims at evaluating lung cancer treatment patterns in a primarily
rural region - Southwest
Georgia (SWGA).
Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study
included 976 black and white
lung cancer patients who resided in SWGA and were diagnosed from
2001 to 2003. Cases
were identified through Georgia Cancer Registry (GCR).
Patient-/disease-related
characteristics, and treatment relevant data were obtained directly
from medical records. We
used logistic regression modeling to calculated crude and adjusted
odds ratios (ORs) and the
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reflecting the
association between various
patient- and disease-related characteristics and receipt of
treatment for lung cancer (surgery,
radiation, chemotherapy). A separate analysis was conducted to
evaluate determinants of
receiving no treatment at al .
Results: No statistically significant associations were
observed between race (Black versus
White) and treatment receipt among SWGA lung cancer patients with
OR of 0.64 (95% CI:
0.39-1.06) for surgery, OR=0.84 (95% CI: 0.62-1.14) for radiation,
OR=0.64 (95% CI: 0.43-
0.96) for chemotherapy. Older patients had a statistically
significantly lower likelihood of
receiving treatment in al analyses. Married individuals were more
likely to receive any kind
of treatment compared with those not married (single, separated,
divorced, or widowed).
Patients with earlier stage of lung cancer were also more likely to
receive surgery but were
less likely to receive radiation and chemotherapy or have no
treatment at al .
Conclusion: Our findings confirmed previous reports
indicating that marital status and age
are important determinants of treatment receipt among lung cancer
patients. No racial
differences were observed in this largely rural region, which is
consistent with our earlier
observations in the SWGA population. Further investigations are
needed in both SWGA
and other rural areas of the country to extend the analysis beyond
treatment receipt, and to
evaluate predictors of treatment completion and survival among lung
cancer patients.","Table of Contents -- INTRODUCTION --

the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic

cross-sectional descriptive study guided by a synthesis of the
Health Belief Model and the ecological framework for eating
behavior. Women aged 18-45 years, within five years of their pGDM
pregnancy, completed questionnaires about demographic factors,
individual perceptions of risk, benefits and barriers to healthy
eating, dietary self-efficacy, general social support, components
of family functioning, and habitual dietary intake. A basic
cardiometabolic health assessment was performed to determine the
presence of MetS or T2DM risk defined by abnormal hemoglobin A1C
values. Analyses included descriptive, bivariate, multivariate
linear and logistic regression.
Results: Participants (n = 75)
included women (55% Minority) who were within a mean of 2.6 years
since their pGDM pregnancy. AHEI diet quality was suboptimal
(M = 47.6, SD = 14.3). Individual factors that
significantly predicted better AHEI diet quality were higher levels
of education status and dietary self-efficacy (R2
= .36, F(6, 66) = 6.19, p = &lt;.0001). No social or
family-level factor predicted diet quality beyond the individual
factors. Nearly half (47%) had abnormal hemoglobin A1C levels, and
19% were at risk for MetS. AHEI diet quality was not associated
with risk for either T2DM or MetS.
Discussion: These findings highlight
the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors, the suboptimal AHEI
diet quality, and the modifiable influences that contribute to AHEI
dietary quality in women with pGDM. Interventions designed to
improve diet quality in women with pGDM should incorporate
enhancing dietary self-efficacy. This study provides a foundation
to further investigate dietary influences in a longitudinally
designed study to assess the causal direction of the
associations.","Chapter 1 -

Identity in Spain, From the Franco Regime to the Present
Democracy","The purpose of this project was to explore how atrocities
committed by the authoritarian
Franco dictatorship have affected the collective memory and
national identity of Spaniards. My research
led to five principal findings. First, that democratic Spain made a
deliberate decision to give political
amnesty to past human rights abusers in an effort to move forward
politically without looking back. Second,
that the Franco regime attempted to reconstruct history to create a
unified social memory. Third, that
there are significant generational differences in Spaniards'
opinions of the Franco regime, as illustrated
by my data. Fourth, that the national identity imposed upon
Spaniards by the Franco regime has given
way to an array of regional identities largely because the regime
severely suppressed all non-conformist
ideas and identities. Finally, this paper argues that Spaniards are
only now learning about many
atrocities of the past because the nation has reached the critical
point at which nearly al of those
citizens with first-hand experiences from the dictatorship have
passed away.
In the same way that Spain experienced a transition to democracy in
the late 1970s, the nation
has undergone a gradual shift in memory of the past that has
contributed to political discord in such
areas as the Spanish National High Court. My analysis demonstrates
that the creation or continuation of
a national collective memory is integral to the stability of a
national identity. While Spain is used here as
a case study, many of my findings regarding collective memory and
national identity may have bearing
on other nations that have converted from authoritarian rule to
democracy. This thesis details the way
in which collective memory and forgetting can be legally and
socially institutionalized, and how national
identity hinges on a common conception of the past.","Table of Contents -- AUTHOR'S

 Previous studies have analyzed the effects
of militarization on levels of violence in regards to the drug war
in Mexico, but they have been forced to adopt qualitative
approaches due to data constraints. With the recent release of
newly refined data, however, scholarship is able to employ
empirical analyses when studying this relationship. The paper
presented here is one of the first studies to quantitatively
analyze the effects of militarization on levels of violence in
Mexico. Even though I am unable to solve the problem of
endogeneity, as greater violence may result in the use of the
military to confront domestic security threats, I can still suggest
possible correlations between troop deployments and drug
trafficking related homicides. Generally speaking, the relationship
between troop deployments and homicides is strongly and positively
correlated, suggesting that militarization can lead to greater
levels of violence. More specifically, the use of the military to
confront drug cartels can possibly increase the amount of drug
cartel member deaths and fatalities of persons of authority. On the
contrary, it appears that militarization may not result in
heightened fatalities caused by violent confrontations. Instead,
the geographic location of the state might be a more significant
causal factor, as border states tend to have higher amounts of
violent confrontation deaths than non-border states. Finally, the
results suggest that economic conditions do not have a significant
impact on levels of violence.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I - Introduction Page 1 -- Chapter II

two topics in graph theory with many problems which are being
actively
investigated. Both subjects involve finding substructures
within
graphs, or general graph-like structures, under certain
conditions.
We consider an extremal problem regarding multigraphs with
edge
multiplicity bounded by a positive integer $q$. Given a
family
$\mathcal{F}$ of $q$-multigraphs, define $\ex(n,\mathcal{F})$ to
be
the maximum number of edges (counting multiplicities) that a
$q$-multigraph on $n$ vertices can have without containing a copy
of
any $F \in \mathcal{F}$ (not necessarily induced). It is well
known
that $\tau(\mathcal{F}) = \lim_{n \to \infty}
\ex(n,\mathcal{F})/\binom{n}{2}$ exists for every family
$\mathcal{F}$
(finite or infinite). Let $\mathcal{T} = \{\tau(\mathcal{F})
:
\mathcal{F} \textrm{ is a family of $q$-multigraphs}\}$. We say
the
number $\alpha$, $0 \leq \alpha &lt; q$ is a jump for $q$ if there
exists
a constant $c = c(\alpha,q)$ such that if $\alpha' \in
\mathcal{T}$
such that $\alpha' &gt; \alpha$ then $\alpha' \geq \alpha + c$. We
show
that, for $3$-multigraphs, every number in the interval $[0,2)$ is
a
jump.
Given two (hyper)graphs $T$ and $S$, the induced Ramsey
number,
$r_{\mathrm{ind}}(T,S)$, is defined to be the smallest integer
$N$
such that there exists a (hyper)graph $R$ with the following
property:
In any two-coloring of the edges of $R$ with red and blue, we
can
always find a red \emph{induced} copy of $T$ or a blue
\emph{induced}
copy of $S$. In this dissertation we will discuss bounds for
$r(K^{(k)}_{t,\dots,t}, K_s^{(k)})$ where $K^{(k)}_{t,\dots,t}$ is
the
complete $k$-partite $k$-graph with partition classes of size $t$.
We
also present new upper bounds for $r_{\mathrm{ind}}(S, T)$, where
$T
\subseteq K^{(k)}_{t,\dots,t}$ and $S \subseteq K_s^{(k)}$.","1 Introduction 1 -- 1.1 Basic concepts . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Sexual Ethics Beyond Sexual Difference:
Luce Irigaray and the Ethics of ""Women's"" Writing
This dissertation suggests that the experience of non-subjectivity
presents an opportunity
for imagining an ethical personhood beyond the reductive economy of
a selfsame
subjectivity. I propose that an ethics of open-ended multiplicity
can emerge through the
indeterminacy afforded by deconstructing the binary of sexual
difference. To frame the
question of ethics as a problem of sameness to be overcome, I read
Luce Irigaray's work,
Éthique De La Différence Sexuelle, as a feminist
response to Emmanuel Levinas. By
dissimilating the feminine from masculine language, Irigaray's work
answers Levinas's
insistence on radical alterity through the question of the
feminine. I contend that Irigaray's mimetic writing
deconstructs the feminine such that the feminine becomes an
indeterminate space of
materiality, infinity, plurality, and relationality beyond the
discursive boundaries of a
concrete notion of ""woman"" that might otherwise be suggested by her
language of sexual
difference. This project therefore moves beyond Irigaray's specific
language of sexual
difference as the condition of alterity. I claim that Irigaray's
writing offers a space of
indeterminate beings where alterity is preserved through
relationship with the flesh of
one's irreducible others. I conclude by suggesting that writing
through the indeterminacy of an identity
like ""woman,"" as Irigaray has done, embraces the uncertainty and
irreducibility of radical
alterity. When one writes through that uncertainty, one's writing
enacts an ethical
openness beyond the binary of male-female difference that disrupts
the totalizing and, as
Levinas would say, ""allergic"" way of relating to the differences of
this world.

aza-Achmatowicz Approach to Piperidine Alkaloids, a Novel Oxidative
Route to Acyloxypyrrolinones, and IMDAF Studies Toward a Synthesis
of Minfiensine and Morphine","Several cis-2-methyl-6-substituted piperidin-3-ol
alkaloids exhibit biological activities and thus have become
important synthetic targets. To develop more efficient approaches
to alkaloids, we have employed the aza-Achmatowicz oxidative
rearrangement of N-tosylaminofurans to access the
cis-2,6-disubstituted piperidine core. This key oxidation
reaction was used to prepare a versatile intermediate which was
then transformed to several piperidine alkaloids. Such methodology
was demonstrated by the total synthesis of azimic acid,
deoxocassine, cassine, and spicigerine. Additionally, we report a
new method for obtaining optically active
N-tosylaminofurans, also providing access to
optically-active piperidine natural products.
Work focused on furan rearrangement chemistry has also resulted
in the discovery of a novel iodine-promoted rearrangement reaction
of 2-amidofurans to acyloxypyrrolinones. The reaction mechanism
resembles the aza- Achmatowicz mechanism and is general for
preparing several substituted acyloxypyrrolinones. Elaboration of
these substrates provides a novel route to 2,4-disubstituted
pyrroles present in many natural products.
Our interest in using furans to generate alkaloids also led us
to test the IMDAF reaction as a route to the pentacylic alkaloid
minfiensine. Minfiensine has shown a wide variety of medicinal
activity but its synthesis continues to be a significant challenge.
The preparation and cycloaddition of both 2-amidofuran and
2-imidofuran substrates were studied as an approach to minfiensine.
It was possible to prepare the desired tetrahydroindoline using the
intramolecular cycloaddition methodology. Conversion to the core
skeleton of minfiensine is expected to be possible through a
Buchwald/Hartwig amination/iminiumcyclization protocol and is
currently being pursued.
Previously, extensive work in the Padwa laboratories has
employed IMDAF reactions of indolo systems, providing routes to a
variety of natural products. As an extension of this methodology,
we tested the possibility of using the IMDAF reaction of related
benzofuran systems as a potential route to morphine. A variety of
2-substituted benzofurans were generated and submitted to the
cycloaddition conditions. The results obtained indicate that a
significant amount of research is still necessary to determine both
the electronic and conformational requirements for such the IMDAF
reaction before the methodology can be applied toward a synthesis
of morphine.","Chapter 1, Part A: Application of the Aza-Achmatowicz

(Tdap) vaccination among pregnant women in Georgia","Influenza and pertussis are two diseases which pose danger to
pregnant women and newborns. Pregnant women are at increased risk
for complications from influenza, and infants less than 2 months
old have the greatest risk of mortality from pertussis. Vaccination
during pregnancy (i.e. antenatal vaccination), is a safe and
effective strategy to protect mothers and infants. Despite risks
posed by these diseases and the protective benefits afforded by
vaccination, antenatal vaccination rates against seasonal influenza
and pertussis are suboptimal.
Considerable research has sought to understand why pregnant
women remain unvaccinated. Reasons include safety concerns,
perceptions of low disease susceptibility, inadequate knowledge of
vaccination, and no provider recommendation. Barriers also exist
for obstetric providers. Despite awareness of these barriers,
little research has scientifically evaluated evidence-based
interventions to improve vaccination rates.
In dissertation aim 1, we conducted the MOMVAX Study, a
cluster-randomized trial among 325 pregnant women in 11 obstetric
practices in Georgia from 2012-2013 to test the effectiveness of a
comprehensive multi-component intervention package on increasing
likelihood of antenatal influenza and/or Tdap receipt. While
vaccination rates were higher in the intervention group compared to
the control group, differences were not significant.
In aim 2, we examined the effectiveness of the MOMVAX
intervention package on improving knowledge, attitudes and beliefs
about antenatal vaccination. While we observed no overall effects
of exposure to the package, we found that women enrolled in their
third trimester were more likely to have requested family members
to get vaccinated to protect the infant if they were in the
intervention group versus the control group.
In aim 3, using 8 years of data from the Georgia Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System, we explored trends in reasons for
non-receipt of antenatal influenza vaccination from 2004-2011. We
found that while the prevalence of citing certain reasons decreased
over time, safety concerns increased significantly following the
2009/2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and especially among Hispanic
women.
Through the first experimental evaluation of a multi-component
intervention package to improve antenatal vaccination and the
analysis of trends in reasons for non-receipt, this dissertation
contributes to the development of evidence-based interventions to
improve antenatal vaccination.","CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW AND MOTIVATION 1 -- CHAPTER 2: BACKGROUND AND

The Association of Ozone and Particulate Matter Exposure to
Asthma Related Hospital Visits in Mississippi

By Gregory J. Schwartz

In 2006, 22.9 million Americans were estimated to have asthma. This
thesis
looks at the relationship between asthma related hospital visits
and exposure to ambient
concentrations of ozone and particulate matter &lt; 2.5 µm
(PM2.5). Exposure is measured
remotely via satellite allowing the study to cover entire state of
Mississippi.

A regular network of 1,318 grid cells was overlain the state of
Mississippi. Mean
daily Ozone and PM2.5 exposure, number of asthma related
hospital visits, and
demographic characteristics were determined for each cell from
January 1st, 2003 to
December 31st, 2005. Dual-exposure models were built using
Generalized Estimating
Equations (GEE) to determine the association between hospital
visits and exposures
controlling for demographic characteristics. The study stratified

designation considering the entire population as well as the black
portion of the
population. These models were extended with hierarchical Bayesian
models to account
for conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial and non-spatial
exchangeable random
effects at the grid cell level.

Significant dual-exposure models were found for both urban and
rural regions
when considering the total population. A 2-day lag for ozone and
5-day lag for PM2.5
were used in the urban only model with relative risks of 1.003 (95%
CI = (1.001, 1.006))
and 1.004 (95% CI = (1.000, 1.008)) respectively. The rural only
model used a 2-day lag
for ozone and 4-day lag for PM2.5 with respective
relative risks of 1.002 (95% CI =
(1.001, 1.005)) and 1.002 (95% CI = (1.000, 1.004)). A significant
dual-exposure model
was found for the black only urban area using a 4-day lag for ozone
and a 2-day lag for
PM2.5 with relative risks of 1.004 (95% CI = (1.001,
1.006)) and 1.003 (95% CI = (1.001,
1.006)) respectively. The Bayesian analysis found exchangeable
random effects in the
urban region and spatial random effects in the rural region
improved the model fit
allowing for risk estimates to be made at the grid cell level."," -- Table of Contents --

Intervention for Eating Pathology","Self-monitoring based on recording food is an intervention tool
frequently utilized in eating disorders (EDs) treatment. Appetite
monitoring provides an alternative form of self-monitoring based on
noticing internal appetite cues, that we predicted might be
particularly suitable for subclinical disordered eating pathology.
The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effects of brief
electronic self-monitoring as an early intervention for women at
risk for eating and weight problems. Ninety women with eating and
weight concerns were randomly assigned to either appetite monitor
(AM-App, N=45) or food monitor (FM-App, N=45) for three weeks.
Participants completed a follow-up assessment three weeks after the
end of the intervention to evaluate the sustained effect once
monitoring terminated. Results indicated similar reductions in both
groups on primary outcome measures (binge eating, shape concerns,
dietary intent, and BMI) at post-intervention. These changes were
well maintained at follow-up. Notably, while neither intervention
directly targeted body image, body satisfaction showed some
improvement at post-intervention, which reached a significant level
at follow-up, suggesting that improved regulation of eating
behavior may have a delayed effect on body satisfaction. Results
indicated a significant decrease in risk factors for eating
pathology, including binge eating, dietary intent, shape concerns,
and BMI) for both electronic appetite and food monitoring, and
showed that these reductions were sustained for three weeks after
monitoring was terminated. Baseline data were used to evaluate the
relationships among the variables hypothesized to serve as risk
factors within the dual pathway model of eating pathology (Stice,
Ziemba, Margolis, &amp; Flick, 1996). Support was found for the
dieting pathway leading to binge eating but not for the
hypothesized negative affect pathway.","Introduction.............................................................1

HIV-associated Pulmonary Hypertension

By Kristi Michelle Porter
There are approximately 39 million people infected with
human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) worldwide.
Previously, the hallmark characteristic of HIV-1 was enhanced
susceptibility to opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis
pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae. The
advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly
reduced the incidence of infectious disorders and improved
survival. However, HIV-infected persons
now demonstrate a heightened risk of developing
non-infectious lung disorders such as HIV-associated
pulmonary arterial hypertension (HIV-PAH). HIV-PAH is a disorder
characterized by increased pulmonary vascular tone and remodeling.
PAH in HIV-1 patients occurs more frequently and progresses more
rapidly than in uninfected individuals irrespective of
CD4+ lymphocyte counts. These findings suggest that
the interaction of HIV-1 proteins with the pulmonary vascular
endothelium may play a critical role in HIV-PAH development by
altering pathways that regulate vascular tone and
remodeling such as arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase
(ALOX5). We hypothesize that the presence of HIV-1
proteins and hypoxia exposure augment pulmonary vascular
dysfunction and PAH by altering ALOX5 expression and
activity.
The central hypothesis of this work is hypoxia exposure
and HIV-1 proteins concomitantly promote the
development of HIV-PAH by stimulating endothelial cell
proliferation and vascular remodeling via increased 5-lipoxygenase
expression and activity. In vitro results
demonstrate that exposure of pulmonary artery endothelial cells to
prolonged hypoxia, medium from HIV-infected macrophages and HIV-1
Tat increases ALOX5 expression. Research also reveals that hypoxia
exposure induces endothelial proliferation in an ALOX5-dependent
manner, and that medium from HIV-infected macrophages potentiates
hypoxia-induced cellular proliferation. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that excessive reactive oxygen species production and
reduced antioxidant expression mediate the hypoxia-induced
increases in ALOX5 and cell proliferation. Additionally, in
vivo results reveal that HIV-1 transgenic animals develop an
exacerbated form of hypoxia-induced PH when compared to wild-type
animals. The ALOX5 pathway is implicated in the increased severity
of PH in HIV-1 transgenic animals, as they demonstrate elevated
levels of ALOX5 and its metabolites. Collectively, these results
indicate that the presence of HIV-1 proteins likely impact
pulmonary vascular resistance and increase susceptibility to
hypoxia-induced PH by stimulating the ALOX5 pathway.","Chapter 1. Introduction - Page 1 -- Pulmonary Hypertension - Page 2

Making Writing Meaningful: A Sociocultural Analysis of Student
Perceptions of the
Authenticity of Writing Tasks
By Nadia Behizadeh
The present trend in educational reform towards standardization and
a focus on basic
skills conflicts with the theories of a number of prominent
educational researchers who advocate
for authentic learning as an effective way to increase student
engagement and achievement,
particularly in teaching writing. However well-intentioned, NCLB
does not work (Mintrop &amp;
Sunderman, 2009), and it is time to create (or return to) policies,
curricula, and professional
development that support the development of authentic learning
experiences for all students.
Although scholars support authentic learning and agree that for an
academic task to be perceived
by students as authentic, that task needs to connect to the
―real world‖ of the students
(Newmann, Marks, Gamoran, 1996; Splitter, 2009), very little
research has explored what makes
particular activities or tasks authentic for students.
The purpose of this study is threefold. The primary purpose of this
study is to determine
what factors affect student perceptions of the authenticity of
academic writing tasks. The second
purpose is to condense students' perceptions into a generalized
student-based definition of
authenticity, and the third and final purpose of the study is to
examine the psychometric
properties of a proposed measure, the Perceived Authenticity of
Writing Scale. In order to
achieve these purposes, I surveyed and interviewed a diverse group
of 8th grade students to
gather data on their perceptions of the authenticity of two major
writing tasks: a narrative essay
and an expository (compare and contrast) essay. The major findings
of this study include a need
for a classroom community of writers who share their work with each
other, but also share their
work with wider audiences in order to have a global impact. Also,
the survey findings and
interview themes align with the theory of Culturally Relevant
Pedagogy (Ladson-Billings, 2009)
and the practice of Participatory Action Research (Ginwright &amp;
Noguera, 2006; Hosang, 2006;
Morrell, 2008).

Contemporary Sculpture and Installation","I define a ""process"" as a series of actions or steps taken in
order to achieve a particular end, including a series
of alterations and improvements that may occur naturally or
synthetically. My understanding of the artistic process also has
evolved during my four years in college. I have
learned at Emory that one often needs to make large mistakes before
he/she ultimately can create good work. This also
applies to art historical writing. The process of deciphering who
really has the largest influence on my work in sculpture is just as
difficult as writing this thesis itself. I soon
realized that it is artists who share their process in their work
who inspire me. Discovering that I primarily value the
process most has been a process and I plan to determine in this
paper how and why the work of Richard Long, Christo and
Jeanne-Claude and other contemporary sculptors reflect their
progression and how their doing so inspires me.
Wrapping trees and the distortion/regulation of nature comprises my
process. In doing so, I try to emulate Christo and
Jeanne-Claude by taking majestically large objects, things larger
than my body, and covering, or transforming, them.
Christo and Jeanne-Claude proved to the world that nothing exists
that is so expansive that it cannot be ""conquered"" by art
alone. Richard Long has also strongly influenced my
work. Like him, I use natural forms and place them in
inorganic settings. Long was able to illustrate for
his viewers that the journey - in his case that long walks, taken
to create the artwork, is just as, if not more, important than the
finished product. I think that Long's emphasis on the
process of creating artwork heavily influences my sculpture
projects. These two radically different artists,
however, act as inspirations for dissimilar reasons.
In this paper I explore whether Richard Long, Christo and
Jeanne-Claude are more similar than previously thought, despite
diverse subject matter, material and scale, and explain how their
processes of creating art have influenced mine.","Chapter I -

Tetrachloride Contaminant
Plume in Groundwater at the Former Union Carbide India Limited
Factory in
Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India
The Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) factory in Bhopal, Madhya
Pradesh is
the site of one of the world's worst industrial disasters. In 1984,
a gas release of
Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) caused the deaths of thousands within weeks
and
thousands more since. After this incident, the factory operations
ceased and the site
was abandoned. However, remediation activities have yet to take
place, which
means that the pesticide products and their production
intermediates serve as
ongoing pollutants to the environment, in particular, the
groundwater. In order to
evaluate the effect of this contamination, the following study
attempts to describe
the contaminant plume of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in the
groundwater using
analytical models provided by publicly the available software known
as analytical
contaminant transport analysis system (ACTS). CCl4 is known to have
adverse
effects on human health when consumed through the drinking water
and is
classified as possibly carcinogenic by the Department of Health and
Human Services
(DHHS). The calibrated deterministic results show that
concentrations of CCL4 do
not exceed the U.S. EPA maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) roughly
850m from
the source in the northeast direction. Probabilistic simulations
show that there is a
100% probability that CCl4 concentrations exceed WHO specified MCL
up to the
year 2034 at sites 500m, 1000m and 2000m northeast of the UCIL
site. Analytical
models are an effective tool in decision making for environmental
managers and
policymakers. As many of the parameters used as inputs for the
analytical model
were based on sparse field data and literature values, it is
recommended that future
studies should aim to better characterize the hydrogeological
system of which the
land surrounding the UCIL site is a part. This information will
help to generate more
representative analytical models with which to analyze the
contaminant plume.","Table of Contents -- I. Background (p.1 - p.3) -- 1. The Bhopal

of the Pyloric Circuit Following Isolation from Neuromodulatory
Inputs","We use a simple, invertebrate neural circuit to study
neural systems' adaptive ability. The pyloric circuit of the
stomatogastric ganglion is an example of a central pattern
generator that controls muscles needed for food particle sorting in
crustaceans. As a central pattern generator, the pyloric circuit
controls an oscillatory behavior that must be maintained in the
face of a changing environment. A well-studied property of this
circuit is its ability to regain a stable activity rhythm after
losing it for several days due to isolation from neuromodulatory
inputs via decentralization. Previous research supports that this
functional rhythm recovery results from readjustment of cells'
conductance parameters as both a direct response to loss of
neuromodulatory inputs and an indirect response to changes in
cells' own electrical activity. We investigated the circuit's
electrical activity patterns following decentralization in order to
gain a better understanding of the recovery process. We used
continuous extracellular recordings of pyloric activity following
decentralization in both untreated preparations and preparations
treated with chondroitinase ABC, an enzyme known to delay or
prevent reemergence of stable rhythm. We looked for differences in
activity following decentralization between treatment groups and
for aspects of post-decentralization activity that are predictive
of the stable rhythm that is later regained. Across many measures
used to quantify features of electrical activity, we did not find
strong evidence that electrical activity following decentralization
is predictive of adaptive ability.","List of

Biomaterial Design: Human Tropoelastin
By Yunyun Pei
Elastin is an important protein that provides connectivity and
elasticity in the
extracellular matrix. It is an extremely insoluble protein due to
the extensive
cross-linking at Lys residues. Tropoelastin is the soluble
precursor of elastin, and
therefore is of great importance for structure-function
relationship of elastin study.
The work described herein is focused on design and expression
of
recombinant human tropoelastin in E. coli. In this study,
five plasmids pJ246/STEL_1,
pJ246/STEL_V2, pJ246/STEL_V3, pJ246/STEL_V4, pJ246/STEL_V5
harboring the
gene encoding the tropoelastin 1-5 sequences, respectively were
optimized by DNA
2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) and they were employed as sources of the gene.
These five
sequences encode the same amino acid sequences of tropoelastin
while having
different GC content and were expected to have different expression
levels. These five
genes were expressed in different vector systems to determine the
optimal conditions
for high-level protein expression using regular induction. To
enhance the expression
yield, auto-induction was used for later experiments in different
cell lines.
Polyhistidine tagged tropoelastins at N-terminal were constructed
and expected to be
more stable than the native protein. Future studies with the
purified tropoelastin may
include cross-linking studies and incorporation of proline
analogues to investigate the
structure of tropoelastin.","Table of contents --

the 1956 Suez Crisis","The 1956 Suez Crisis is traditionally interpreted as the moment
when the United States assumed Western leadership in its entirety,

Egypt with France and Israel, retreated from any imperial

paper argues that such a view indicates an unconsidered assessment
of the crisis and is wholly unsupported by the diplomatic and
historical record. Rather, the Suez Crisis was but a single episode
in the complex and developing post-war Anglo-American alliance: any
ill will was quickly swept under the rug as both the United States
and the United Kingdom realized that through cooperation instead of
opposition they could each better achieve their interests
throughout the Middle East, namely continued access to the region's
petroleum and ""containment"" of the spread of international
Communism. These were the two chief prizes for British and American
statesmen, and both oil and the Soviet threat played a key role in
Anglo-American diplomacy before, during, and after the Suez
episode. Entrenched grudges and American economic pressure
transformed the Suez Crisis from an unpleasant geopolitical
conflict into one that was intensely personal. However, the United
States and the United Kingdom were wiser than to allow bruised egos
to prevent a continuation of their war-time partnership in this
most vital of theaters, the Middle East, and each, therefore,
strove to further his individual and shared interests in the region
through cooperation and consultation with the other.","Introduction 1 -- Chapter I: Deciding to Fight 3 -- Chapter II: A

Interpreting On and Off-Screen Lesbianism:
A Case Study of Emory University College Students
By Zoe DuPree Fine
Television is a powerful agent of socialization in our culture,
a structure that
reflects back to society that which is appropriate and acceptable,
and a medium that
presents images of lesbians infrequently and in limited ways. I
investigate how young
audience members of today make meaning of lesbian images on
television, how they feel
about lesbians in reality, and how their social locations relate to
both their views and
interpretations. This thesis examines how Emory University College
students interpret
lesbian representation on television today.

I created and distributed an online survey that asked respondents
to report basic
information about themselves, their attitudes about lesbians in
reality, and their
interpretations of lesbian TV representations. The survey requested
information about
Emory College students' social locations with questions about their
same-sex attraction,
gender, proximity/contact with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer
(LGBQ) people,
religiosity, and socio-economic status (SES), and I analyzed these
variables in relation to
students' individual interpretations of lesbian TV portrayals and
their attitudes about
lesbians in reality. With feminist, sociological, and media theory,
I examine how young
audiences of today who occupy different social locations feel about
lesbians on and off
the television screen. This thesis begins with an historical
overview of lesbians on
American television, and concludes with an analysis of my collected
quantitative data.","Table of Contents -- Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Critical Philosophy:
Immanuel Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason
By
Colin McQuillan
Critical Philosophy: Immanuel Kant and the Critique of Pure
Reason examines the concept of ""critique,"" as it is employed by
Immanuel Kant in the Critique
of Pure Reason (1781/1787). While many readers assume that Kant
intended the Critique of Pure Reason to
establish the limits of reason, my dissertation shows that the work
attempts to determine the possibility
of a science of metaphysics through a critique of the faculty of
human reason. The critical approach to
metaphysics that Kant develops in the Critique of Pure Reason is
novel, because critique had been a
primarily philological concept in the eighteenth century, when it
was associated with the authentication
of ancient texts and the determination of their sources. Kant
appropriated the term in the early 1770's,
applying it to a problem with which he had been concerned since the
time of his earliest, ""pre-critical""
works. This is the problem of the proper method of metaphysics. The
discussions of a critique of pure
reason that are to be found in Kant's notes, lectures, and
correspondence, as well as the Critique of Pure
Reason itself, afford us a unique insight into the development of
Kant's ""critical"" philosophy, when we
realize that they are the direct result of Kant's application of
the concept of critique to problem of the
proper method of metaphysics. By examining these texts, my
dissertation helps scholars to understand
the reasons why Kant thought the possibility of a science of
metaphysics depended upon the
determination and authentication of the sources of metaphysics in
the faculties of human reason. It
provides a historical and contextual account of the development of
Kant's critical philosophy which is
unique in the scholarly literature.

Primate Putamen","Striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) are central for the
processing and reinforcement of goal-directed and habitual
reward-related behaviors that can be negatively affected in states
of altered dopamine transmission such as in Parkinson's disease.
Although significant advances have been made in understanding the
mechanisms by ChIs involvement in such behaviors, the development
of potential therapeutic interventions that target ChI activity has
been hampered by our limited knowledge about the network of
connections that target ChIs. Anatomical, pharmacological, and
electrophysiological studies in rodents and primates have
demonstrated that striatal ChI activity is modulated by GABAergic
and glutamatergic inputs. However, the source(s) and prevalence of
these inputs have not been clarified. The main objective of this
thesis was therefore to perform a quantitative ultrastructural
analysis of the GABAergic inputs from direct (substance
P-containing) and indirect (enkephalin-containing) striatofugal
neurons, as well as inputs from GABAergic and glutamatergic
parvalbumin-containing neurons, onto ChIs in the monkey
putamen.
Electron microscopic observations from double-labeled (i.e.,
immunogold and immunoperoxidase) tissue revealed that approximately
60% of all synaptic inputs to ChIs originate from GABAergic
terminals, where 24% of this innervation is derived from axon
collaterals of direct and indirect striatal projection neurons, and
10% from striatal and/or pallidal GABAergic parvalbumin-containing
neurons. Of the remaining synaptic inputs to ChIs, 21% are
putatively glutamatergic, half of which originate from
parvalbumin-containing neurons in the thalamus, and 19% from other
(non-GABAergic) sources. The distribution of these synaptic inputs
to striatal ChIs follows two major patterns: (1) GABAergic
terminals that express substance P or enkephalin terminate on the
entire somatodendritic domain of ChIs, whereas (2) medium- and
small-sized dendrites of ChIs are targets of parvalbumin-containing
GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs.
Altogether, these studies have revealed an extensively diverse
synaptic network between ChIs and their GABAergic and glutamatergic
afferents, resulting in the first detailed map of ChI connectivity
in the monkey striatum. Future studies in relation to the
prevalence and pattern of additional ChI afferents, combined with a
detailed description of changes in this afferent synaptic network
in pathological conditions, will help to further characterize the
substrate that underlies the role of ChIs in striatal functions in
normal and diseased states.","Abstract iii -- Acknowledgements vi -- Table of Contents vii --

Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit","Introduction: There is evidence that vitamin D is
integral to the function of the innate immune response and that low
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations may be a risk
factor for infection. There have been no prospective studies
examining the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and the
risk for hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in patients admitted to
the intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods: This is a prospective observational cohort of
adult patients admitted to the Emory University medical ICU at
Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia from November 1, 2011
through October 31, 2012. Patients were included in the study if
they were anticipated to have an ICU stay â‰¥ 1 day
and did not refuse enrollment, and excluded if they were not able
to undergo study phlebotomy within 5 days of ICU admission.
Results: The cohort consisted of 314 subjects, with 136
(43%) of subjects deficient in vitamin D, as evidenced by serum
25(OH)D concentrations &lt; 15 ng/mL. The patient characteristics
significantly associated with low 25(OH)D levels included admission
during winter months (28% vs. 18%, p = 0.04), higher
PaO2/FiO2 (275 Â± 142 vs. 226
Â± 243 torr, p = 0.03) and longer time from ICU admission
to study phlebotomy (1.8 vs. 1.5 days, p = 0.02). A total of 36
(11%) patients developed an HAI prior to discharge, death or within
30 days from ICU admission. In multivariate analysis adjusting for
gender, APACHE II score, time to study phlebotomy, ICU length of
stay and net volume status, serum 25(OH)D levels &lt; 15 ng/mL were
not associated with risk for HAIs (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.44 -
2.00).
Conclusions: In this prospective, observational cohort of
adults admitted to a single-center medical ICU, there was no
significant association between 25(OH)D deficiency and the risk for
HAI.","-- Introduction --

Steroidal regulation of vasotocin receptor mRNA in a seasonally
breeding songbird
Behaviors associated with breeding are often seasonally modulated
in a variety of species.
These seasonal changes in behavior are mediated by gonadal
steroids, levels of which likewise
vary with season. The effects of androgens on behaviors associated
with breeding may in turn
be partly mediated by the neurohypophyseal nonapeptides vasopressin
(VP) and oxytocin (OT)
in mammals, and vasotocin (VT) in birds. The effects of
testosterone (T) on production of these
neuropeptides has been well-investigated; however, the regulation
of VT receptors
well understood. In this study, I investigated steroidal regulation
of VT receptor (VTR) mRNA in
a seasonally breeding songbird, the white-throated sparrow (
Zonotrichia albicollis). VTRs and
their mammalian homologues occur as several subtypes, and I focused
on subtypes that have
been most strongly implicated in social behavior: V1a, which bears
the same name as its
mammalian homologue, and OT-like receptor, which is homologous to
mammalian OT receptor
(OTR). Using in situ hybridization, I showed that in
response to T treatment, V1a and OT-like
receptor expression was altered in several regions associated with
seasonal reproductive
behaviors such as song. In some regions, the effects of T treatment
depended on the presence
or absence of a chromosomal rearrangement that affects singing
behavior, plasma
testosterone, and VT immunolabeling in this species. Overall, the
results of this study
strengthen evidence that VT may mediate T's behavioral effects in
songbirds, and suggest that
the chromosomal rearrangement in this species may affect the
sensitivity of the vasotocin
system to seasonal changes in T.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Methods 4 -- Results 10 --

For decades, research has shown an association between having a
cardiovascular event (CVD)
and the development of stress, anxiety, or depression (SAD). These
studies indicate a strong
association between individuals reporting a CVD event and later
reporting SAD. As well, many
years of research have shown a strong association between
inflammatory disorders (INF) and
SAD. As expected, individuals with active inflammatory disease are
more likely to experience
SAD. This analysis examines the temporal relationship between
reporting SAD prior to a CVD
event or an INF. Logistic regresion models were conducted with
variables considered to be non-
modifiable risk factors.

The data analyzed for this study support the temporal association
between SAD and CVD events
or INF. A fully adjusted model, controlling for demographic
variables, for the SAD-CVD
association indicated a positive association between reporting a
prior SAD diagnosis and
reporting a subsequent CVD diagnosis, OR: 1.68; CI: 1.45, 1.94;
P&lt;.0001. For the SAD-INF
association, a fully adjusted model indicated a positive
association between reporting a prior
anxiety and a subsequent INF diagnosis, OR: 2.87; CI: 2.19, 3.78;
P&lt;.0001.

Depressive Symptoms among Older Adults with Arthritis","BACKGROUND: Physical functioning and mental
health are critical issues among the aging population. Literature
has found a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety in people
with arthritis. While evidence has supported the efficacy of
participation in physical activity as a protective factor that
could delay comorbid chronic diseases and improve mental health
among older adults, as well as adults with arthritis, literature
also shows that almost half of the adult arthritis patients do not
participate in leisure time physical activity. There are sparse
studies about the dose-response effect of physical activity on
mental health among aging population with arthritis.
OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to analyze the association
between physical activity participation among older adults with
arthritis and psychological distress using secondary data. The
study also examined whether there was difference in psychological
distress among older adults who participated in light and moderate
or vigorous physical activity, or strength activity.
METHODS: The study used cross-sectional data from the 2012
National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative,
in-person, household interview survey to estimate the prevalence of
being psychologically distressed in adults aged 60 or older with
arthritis (n =3,197). The association between psychological
distress and demographic factors and participation in physical
activity was also examined using multivariable logistic
regression.
RESULTS: In the aging population with arthritis, psychological
distress was significantly associated with younger age, gender,
race, and current activity limitation due to arthritis. After
controlling the covariates, those who reported being very actively
participated in moderate- and vigorous physical activity were
nearly 55 % less likely to report mild or severe psychological
distress (AOR=0.45; 95%CI=0.30, 0.69; P&lt;.001), than those who
were inactive. Those who reported being active were 50% less likely
(AOR=0.50; 95%CI=0.33, 0.76; P&lt;.001), and those who reported
being slightly active were 35% less likely (AOR=0.65;
95%CI=0.50,0.84; P&lt;.01) to report mild or severe psychological
distress. Respondents who reported doing strength training physical
activity 3 to 5 times per week were 53 % less likely to have mild
or severe psychological distress (AOR=0.47; 95%CI=0.26, 0.86;
P&lt;.05).","--

Who Are Sex Workers in Cape Town, South Africa","Background: Sex workers are more vulnerable to HIV
infection than persons in other occupations, but their professional
work also carries additional health risks that are less commonly
addressed. Violence, stigma, discrimination, substance abuse,
mental health disorders, and lack of self-efficacy burden sex
workers, especially in societies where the buying and selling of
sex is criminalized. Most women report entering the sex work
industry to meet pressing financial needs, but are faced with human
rights violations that belittle, batter, and break their capability
to thrive as women, professionals, and mothers.
Purpose: The purpose of this special studies project was
twofold. First, it aimed to explore the needs, resources, barriers,
and facilitators that sex workers living in Cape Town, South Africa
experience in their role as mothers. The Sex Workers Education
&amp; Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT) then implemented a social support
program (""Mothers of the Future"") aimed at reducing barriers female
sex workers face as parents. To provide additional group structure,
facilitator guidance, and session activities, a parenting
curriculum was also developed to specifically address topics
relevant to sex workers' daily lives.
Methods: A community needs assessment framework was
utilized to interview key informants and SWEAT service users. This
qualitative data was then thematically analyzed, and the results
shaped the development of both the Mothers of the Future program
and a nine module parenting curriculum.
Results: The community needs assessment revealed eight
themes sex workers who are mothers identified as salient to their
performance as parents: identity as a sex worker and mother,
reproductive health, child care and safety, social support and
education, social development, legal support, healthcare, and
parental needs. A curriculum was created to educate and support sex
workers who are mothers around these themes.
Discussion: Mothers of the Future aims to address the
vulnerabilities of sex workers who are mothers via technical
communication, and challenge barriers they face via transformative
communication that is developed, led, and sustained by the sex
workers themselves. After the program is piloted, adapted by sex
workers, and evaluated, modifications can be made by peer educators
and sex workers to better suit their needs and context.","Chapter 1: Introduction and Background

Implications for Patient Care and Nurse Retention","Abstract

The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of
internationally
educated nurses (IENs) in comparison to those of U.S. nurses about
their ability to
exercise agency in the context of health care in U.S. hospitals.
Specifically, the aims were
to explore the relationship between agency and retention and
quality of care with regard
to pursuit of nursing education and participation in
governance.

The nursing workforce in urban hospitals may consist of a
significant
percentage of IENs. Nurse migration to the United States increased
as hospitals sought
IENs to maintain staffing levels in the face of a national nursing
shortage. It is important
to understand how the perspectives of these nurses regarding their
agency may influence
patient care.

This exploratory, qualitative study framed by structuration theory
consisted of
two phases of semi-structured interviews. In the first, 82 nurses
were recruited from two
urban hospitals in the Southeastern United States: 21 IENs from
each hospital and 20
U.S. RNs. In the second, 40 nurses, 11 IENs from each hospital and
9 U.S. RNs, were re-
interviewed about themes discovered during the first phase. Data
were collected and
analyzed in an iterative process.

Most IENs plan to remain in nursing in the United States until they
retire. Most
initially received associate degrees in nursing, and many obtained
bachelor degrees in the
United States. Few obtained graduate degrees. Like U.S. RNs, most
do not perceive work
on hospital governance committees to be relevant to their roles as
nurses, nor do they
tend to seek promotions. Both IENs and U.S. RNs experienced
discrimination in the
workplace.

IENs may share perspectives similar to those of U.S. RNs because
they have
adapted to the U.S. hospital environment, reproducing what they
observe in the U.S.
RNs. In general, nurses may not pursue further nursing education or
participate in
hospital governance because they value the individual empowerment
they have providing
direct patient care. They may not see the value of collective
empowerment and/or may
not feel they have the knowledge, training and support for roles
that do not involve direct
patient care.","Table of Contents -- Introductory Chapter -- 1 -- Manuscript for

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Infection Among
Individuals with Initial Invasive Community-Associated MRSA
Infection: A Pilot Study","Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (CA-MRSA) infections have been increasing in incidence
over the past decade, and while some studies have looked at
recurrence in skin and soft tissue CA-MRSA infections, there is no
current literature on recurrence for invasive CA-MRSA infections.
Obesity has been linked to skin and soft tissue infections as well
as recurrent skin and soft tissue MRSA infections, and might have
an impact on invasive MRSA infections as well. This pilot study
aimed to examine the relationship between obesity and recurrent
invasive MRSA infections among individuals with an initial CA-MRSA
infection in the year prior. Data were obtained from the Active
Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system of the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program from
2005-2011. A case-control study was performed for initial CA-MRSA
infections between 2006-2010, comparing cases, defined as
individuals with an initial invasive CA-MRSA infection that went on
to have a second invasive MRSA infection in the year following the
initial infection (recurrence), and controls, defined as
individuals with invasive CA-MRSA infection who did not go on to
have recurrence. There were 253 cases and 2,876 controls
identified, for a total sample size of 3,129, indicating an average
recurrence incidence of 8% annually. Multivariate modeling revealed
a significant relationship between obesity and recurrence (OR 1.84,
95% CI 1.26-2.69, p-value=0.0016), after controlling for age,
diabetes, bacteremia, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, urinary tract
infection, endocarditis, bursitis, and surgical incision infection.
Confounding assessment led to a simpler model that again showed a
significant relationship between obesity and recurrence (OR 1.99,
95% CI 1.40-2.86, p=0.0002). Since recurrence is assumed to be
rare, this indicates that the risk of recurrent invasive MRSA
infections among individuals with an initial invasive CA-MRSA
infection is twice the risk of recurrence among non-obese
individuals. Given the high prevalence of obesity in the United
States and the evidence for increasing incidence of CA-MRSA, this
pilot study should help generate hypotheses for future studies
examining the relationship between obesity and recurrence in
CA-MRSA infections. In particular, these preliminary results
emphasize the need for further analysis using several variables
introduced in 2010 to the ABCs invasive MRSA surveillance case
report form, such as BMI.","-- Introduction....................1 --

from the fall of the Bastille through the Reign of Terror
(1789-1794)","Abstract
By John Gibson
The French Revolution, in changing the political landscape of
Europe and reigning in a new
regime, also destroyed the notion of aristocracy. While some French
nobles and clergy stayed in
the Republic, many of them began a nomadic journey through Europe
in search of shelter from
the stormy climate. The period 1789 to 1794 marks the most frequent
era of departure from
France and symbolizes two defining events of the Revolution; the
storming of the Bastille and
the final moments of the Reign of Terror.
This thesis, fitting within the historiography of royalist
emigration and resistance to the
Revolution, traces aspects of emigration networks in the Prussian
Principality of Neuchatel
during the 1789-1794 timeframe. Neuchatel was of prime importance
for the reception of
refugees during this period due to its defense and neutrality
agreements, Francophone linguistic
heritage, and close proximity to France. Abraham-Louis Fauche-Borel
(1762-1829) has been
known as the host par excellence of the Suisse romande
during the Revolution. However, there
were many Neuchatel citizens besides him who directly involved
themselves in the harboring of
émigrés in the face of the French Republican onslaught.
Although there were many participants
in these efforts, this thesis addresses the involvement of main
policy makers, leading citizens in
royalist networks and hosting.","Table of Contents -- 1. The Fall of French

viability of each technical
step in the asymmetric synthesis of PM-toxin A. A key step in the
synthesis is
the nucleophilic opening of an epoxide via an acetylide ion to
afford the
homopropargylic alcohol. Current methodology for the alkynylation
of epoxides
uses n-butyllithium, for the deprotonation of the terminal
alkyne, and boron
trifluoride-diethyl etherate or boron trifluoride-tetrahydrofuran,
to activate the
epoxide, at low temperatures (e.g., -78 °C). Future work will
include
development of mild reaction conditions for successful Lewis acid
activated
alkynylation of epoxides using a tertiary amine for the
deprotonation of the
terminal alkyne.

In-group vs. out-group","Social categorization in capuchin monkeys ( Cebus
apella): In-group vs. out-group
By Jennifer J. Pokorny
The social groups of most primates consist of individuals of
different ages, sexes, ranks and
relatedness. This complexity requires that group members recognize
and remember the
individuals within ones own group. Furthermore, it is necessary to
distinguish these
individuals from those outside the group as outsiders pose a threat
to a group's food and
mating resources. Humans typically rely on faces as one way to
recognize individuals,
allowing us to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar
individuals, as well as group
individuals into other categories, such as friend, family,
stranger, male or female, young or
old. A previous study in our laboratory demonstrated that capuchin
monkeys ( Cebus apella), a
New World primate species, could discriminate faces of conspecifics
using an oddity task
(Pokorny &amp; de Waal, in press). In the current study, we
examined capuchins' ability to
categorize the faces of conspecifics as belonging to the in-group
or out-group, relative to the
subject, using the oddity paradigm. Follow-up tests ruled out
alternative explanations for
how subjects could solve the task, primarily addressing possible
color cues in the images.
Subjects successfully transferred to novel sets of images,
suggesting that they used
knowledge of familiar individuals depicted in the images to solve
the task of selecting either
in-group or out-group individuals. We also examined whether
subjects were using an oddity
concept to perform the task or whether they were using rules, such
as: 1) select the in-group
member, 2) select the out-group member. Findings reveal that
subjects are likely doing the
latter and not applying the oddity concept to the dimension of
group membership. Overall,
this study provides supporting evidence that nonhuman primates can
recognize conspecifics
in two-dimensional images and differentiate in-group from out-group
members.","Introduction 1 -- Face discrimination and recognition in nonhuman

Specters and Spectacles: The Crime Serials of Louis
Feuillade
By Matt Levine
This thesis stems from a basic question: why were Surrealist
writers and thinkers in the
early twentieth century so entranced by the crime serials of Louis
Feuillade? These shocking,
violent serials- Fantômas (1913-4), Les Vampires
(1915-6), and Judex (1916)-were decried by some
as witless, torrid popular entertainment, but were enshrined by the
Surrealists as awe-inspiring
embodiments of cinema and of the modern age. In characteristic
Surrealist style, such writers and
thinkers lauded Feuillade through grandiose prose, but provided
scant explanation for their
infatuation with him.
While this thesis, at the most general level, attempts to answer
that question, it will do so
by venturing down several related paths. ""Specters and Spectacles""
will place Feuillade's crime
serials within the context of a cinematic transitional period that
spanned the 1900s and 1910s-a
period that often teetered between the shocking, exhibitionist
displays of a ""cinema of attractions""
and a rapidly coalescing narrative cinema that would soon come to
dominate international
filmmaking. This project will also relate Feuillade's crime serials
to the ""modernity thesis,"" which
hypothesized that the cinema in general manifested the numerous
social, cultural, economic,
technological, political, and artistic transformations engendered
by the onset of industrial
modernity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Finally, this thesis will attempt to
link together these interrelated concepts through the broad theory
of a ""cinematic mode of
uncertainty""-a broad paradigm that essentially forces us to
question the veracity of cinematic
vision and knowledge, to recognize the heavily mediated nature of
all cinematic production, and to
reconsider the generic, narrative, and conceptual taxonomies that
tend to dominate the field of
Film Studies.

""There Was a Tradition Among the Women"":
New Orleans's Colored Creole Women and the Making of a Community
in the Tremé and Seventh Ward, 1791-1930
By Natasha L. McPherson
This dissertation examines how colored Creole women shaped
family and community formation and influenced the development of a
Creole ethnic identity in New Orleans between the late-eighteenth
century and 1930. First, I explore women's role in the growth and
expansion of a visible colored Creole community in the antebellum
era. I look closely at the way Creole women responded to the loss
of their privileged intermediate legal status after the Civil War,
and detail their efforts to preserve the Creoles' antebellum social
privilege for two generations after the fall of slavery. Although
the establishment of Jim Crow segregation finally eliminates the
remaining legal distinctions between colored Creoles and non-Creole
African Americans, colored Creoles continued to enforce strict
cultural boundaries to preserve a separate and distinct Creole
community. I examine the ways in which colored Creole women adapted
old ways and developed new methods to preserve colored Creole
social privilege in the face of Jim Crow.
This project makes three original contributions to the existing
scholarship. First, using census records, I construct a thorough
demographic profile of colored Creole women from the
late-eighteenth century to the early twentieth century. Next, I
explore the ways ordinary women made meaningful contributions to
the Creole community. By paying particular attention to women's
roles in marriage and family; paid and unpaid labor; and their
participation in the sacraments of the Catholic Church, I show that
women were remarkably influential in the preservation of Creole
status. Finally, I argue that Creole women did not conform to
African American middle-class notions of respectability as a means
of preserving status, but rather they adopted a practical morality
that placed the obligations of the family and the improvement of
the larger Creole community above aspirations for individual
morality or respectability. By placing women at the center of this
narrative, I contend that women were central to the establishment
and development of a colored Creole community in New Orleans.","-- CONTENTS -- Introduction -- Chapter One: -- Roots Women: Laying

nonhuman primates","Recent efforts to define the functions of the primate perirhinal
(PRh) cortex have focused on its interaction with the hippocampus
in the mediation of normal memory. Less is known on the functions
of its strong connections to the amygdala (Pitkanen, 2006; Amaral,
2002), a key substrate for emotion regulation. Previous
studies (Meunier &amp; Bachevalier, 2002; Meunier et al.,
2006) showed that PRh lesions in adult monkeys enhanced
defensive responses to threatening stimuli, an effect exactly
opposite to the effects of amygdala lesions (e.g. reduced defensive
responses). Here, we investigated the role of PRh lesions on
the development of emotion regulation in monkeys from infancy
through adulthood. Infant monkeys with either bilateral neurotoxic
PRh lesions (Neo-PRh; males = 3, females = 3), or sham operations
(Neo-C; male = 2, females = 2), performed between 7-14 days of age
were used. Emotional reactivity towards a Human Intruder was
evaluated at 2 months, 4.5 months, and 5 years of age using three
conditions (Alone, Profile/no eye contact, and Stare).
Additionally, in adulthood, blood cortisol and ACTH levels were
assessed pre- and post- Human Intruder stressor and across the day.
As compared to controls, group Neo-PRh showed profound changes in
the modulation of freezing, fearful/defensive behaviors, hostility,
self-directed behaviors, stereotypies, cage exploration,
locomotion, and vocalizations to the presence and gaze direction of
a human intruder that were present in infancy and persisted into
adulthood. However, the neonatal lesions of the PRh cortex did not
alter neuroendocrine functions. These behavioral changes were
reminiscent to the heightened defensive responses reported after
adult-onset PRh lesions (Meunier et al., 2006). Therefore, neonatal
lesions to the PRh cortex disrupt the normal development of
emotional regulation, sparing hormonal regulation, in ways
distinctively different from those reported after neonatal amygdala
lesions (Raper et al., 2012). The data suggest that early
dysfunction of the PRh results in abnormal fear reactivity
and provide insights onto the neural underpinning of several
developmental neuropsychiatric disorders associated with
anxiety.","Introduction 1 -- Methods 17 -- Results 28 -- Discussion 37 --

The Caribbean has the world's second highest adult prevalence rate
of HIV after sub-
Saharan Africa and AIDS-related mortality remains the leading cause
of death among 25-44 year
olds in the region. Heterosexual sex is the main route of
transmission throughout the Caribbean.
Women are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection as more than
half of the people living with
HIV are women. Haiti and the Dominican Republic have one of the
highest HIV-positive rates
in the Americas whereas the Cuban population has the lowest
prevalence rate in the Americas
and one of the lowest rates of AIDS-mortality in the Caribbean.

The purpose of this project is to examine how and why AIDS
mortality rates and
transmission patterns vary across three Caribbean countries: Cuba,
the Dominican Republic, and
Haiti. Additionally, the goal of this project is to show how a
small, low-income country like
Cuba has managed to have an extraordinary low prevalence rate of
HIV/AIDS and how the
Cuban response to HIV/AIDS may provide useful strategies to the
Dominican Republic and
Haiti such as awareness and prevention programs, educational
campaigns, and HIV testing and
screening. In an effort to address these questions and offer an
analysis on how culture and
religion, country specific infrastructure, and lack of public
health policies and educational
resources have contributed to the HIV/AIDS crisis in the Caribbean,
a comprehensive review of
relevant literature was conducted. The specific data
reviewed/examined focused on incidence
and prevalence of HIV/AIDS, the origins of HIV/AIDS in the
Caribbean, the history of Cuba, the
Dominican Republic, and Haiti, characteristics of the Cuban,
Dominican, and Haitian
populations, as well as case studies and qualitative studies.

The main findings showed that the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the
Caribbean is still largely
concentrated in most-at-risk populations and that new HIV
infections now affects men and
women equally. As evident in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and
Haiti, many gaps exist in
access to prevention and care as well as in efforts to address the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in the
Caribbean which has been compounded by the social, economic, and
political realities of the
region.","Table of Contents -- Distribution Agreement i -- Approval ii --

workers of a fluoropolymer manufacturing plant","BACKGROUND: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a known human
carcinogen that was released by a chemical plant, contaminating the
drinking water in the mid-Ohio Valley. Occupational exposures in
this plant are much higher than residential exposures from drinking
water consumption.
OBJECTIVE: We examined predictors of PFOA between regular
and contract workers of a chemical plant and determined the
differences between PFOA levels.
METHODS: We studied 4,010 workers of DuPont Washington
Works (WW) who had measured PFOA serum levels from a 2005-2006
survey. Of these, 1,923 were regular workers and 2,087 were
community members who had reported working at DuPont WW in a survey
but were not in the regular worker cohort, the ""contract"" workers.
We also analyzed a subset of workers (48%) for whom we had the
start and end dates of employment. We ran linear regression models
to determine serum PFOA predictors.
RESULTS: Median PFOA serum level was 109.2 ng/mL for
regular workers and 50.8 ng/mL for contract workers. The most
important predictors were worker status (regular workers higher),
years worked at DuPont WW, years worked in the Teflon division,
current water district, and year ending employment (R2
model = 0.49). PFOA was higher for workers who are male, who had a
lower education level, and who began work in recent years. The
effect of more recent years of employment termination on PFOA
levels increased for regular workers compared to contract
workers.
CONCLUSIONS: PFOA levels in contract workers were lower
than regular workers. The effect of the year of employment
termination is different between the worker groups, with much
higher levels in regular workers who had ended employment most
recently.","Introduction.......................................................................................................................

Adoption of Health Information Technology Systems among U.S.
Hospitals 2007-2012
By James W. Wrocklage
Health information technology (HIT) systems are diverse and play
varied roles in improving healthcare delivery. Despite the current
push for the advancement of HIT infrastructure in the U.S.,
adoption rates of HIT systems have been slower than expected. In
addition, most studies that examine adoption rates focus on
specific systems or use non-weighted aggregation. This study
investigated the diffusion of HIT systems by employing a novel,
weighted scale aggregating 18 different clinical IT systems. We
employed proportional hazard modelling to estimate the time to
adoption for basic, medium and advanced levels of HIT
infrastructure, and control for hospital organizational factors.
Our results indicate that small hospitals (&lt;100 beds) are
falling the furthest behind in HIT adoption, and may be failing to
implement even rudimentary HIT technologies. Also, rural and
for-profit hospitals, as well as hospitals with poor network
involvement are lagging behind national averages. As the U.S. moves
toward a nationwide network of intercommunicating health
technologies, these hospitals may become stumbling blocks in the
provision of safe, timely, and effective care. Policy should be
targeted to lagging hospitals in order to meet HIT adoption goals
and prevent the technological gap from widening.","Table of Contents --

Changes in the American Electorate","Political Science research has long examined the connection between
migration and seemingly one-sided political change. While the bulk
of this research has been conducted to analyze the impact of
northern migrants on the southern electorate during the Republican
realignment, limited research has been conducted to determine
whether migration has played a role in recent changes in
presidential elections. Since the Republican victory by just five
electoral votes in the 2000 presidential election, the competitive
presidential landscape has shifted decisively in favor of the
Democratic Party. The Democratic victories in 2008 and 2012 have
easily surpassed 100 electoral votes in each contest. Scholars
disagree on the role that migration has played in this new
presidential landscape. This study aims to both evaluate the role
played by domestic migration in recent changes in presidential
elections and resolve the differing views on domestic migration's
political implications. The results demonstrate that recent
domestic migration has not helped one party more than the other or
consistently contributed to one-sided changes in the two-party
presidential vote share. Moreover, increased polarization does not
appear to strongly alter this conclusion.","Table of Contents --

better survival in Mucosal Melanoma of the Head and Neck (MMHN) at
the subsite level?
By Srijana Rajbhandary
Background: Previously conducted studies did not use
population based data to explore the difference in survival for
mucosal melanoma of the head and neck (MMHN) region at the subsite
level among patients receiving surgery alone versus adjuvant
radiation post-surgery.
Objectives: To explore whether the 5-year cause-specific
survival for MMHN is different for surgery alone compared to
adjuvant radiation therapy post-surgery at the subsite level (nasal
mucosa, paranasal sinuses, oral cavity, and other
sites).
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on MMHN
using population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) registry data from 2001 to 2009. We used multivariable Cox
proportional hazards regression models to compare the 5-year
cause-specific survival of MMHN cases at various
subsites.
Results: Of the 477 MMHN cases meeting study inclusion
criteria, the highest number of cases originated from the nasal
cavity (n= 234). There was no statistical evidence to prove a
survival advantage of adjuvant radiation therapy post-surgery over
surgery alone at any subsite.
Conclusion: In this analysis using population-based cancer
registry data, adjuvant radiation therapy post-surgery did not
result in improved survival for MMHN at any subsite.","Contents -- I. Literature review 1 -- II. Introduction 6 -- III.

Sovereignty in 20th Century Kanker, Central India","Most histories of tribal peoples, even if they conceive of their
subjects as agents in the making of their histories, do so in terms
determined by the rationalist protocols of modernity in which the
tribal life-world is considered archaic and before the time of
history. The life-expressions of tribal peoples are relegated to
the domain of culture/religion separated from the political, worthy
of mention as curio but incapable of providing the terms on which a
history can be rendered.
This study begins with a recognition of the trans-temporality of
our world - both that of modern, urban intellectuals, and of
""tribal"" peasants - to fashion a historical narrative from evidence
of self-presentations by tribal peoples that, though informed by
history, exceed its rationalist strictures. It does so by exploring
present-day popular constructions of the polity of
colonial-princely Kanker in central India that appear in the oral
accounts of the past given in the practices of the ancestral deity
of the Gond peoples of Kanker, the anga dev.
When we make anga dev practices, and accounts, a central
ground of investigation, a radically different understanding of
tribal peoples, power and polity comes into view. The dominant
narratives of ""tribal"" history in the colonial period construct a
story of victimhood or heroic resistance in which tribal peoples
are either passive recipients of, or reactive to, a pre-determined
polity, closed off in the domain of the state. In the popular
accounts, by contrast, the mixed tribe-caste anga dev
communities appear centrally implicated in the making of the
polity. These accounts contain conceptions of the polity in which
sovereign power and authority are imagined in ways that overflow
the constraints of statist historical representation, and are
contested, negotiated, divided and shared between the raja, the
symbol of the colonial-princely state, and the people and their
ancestral gods. The negotiated, divided nature of sovereignty can
be seen clearly in the rituals of the Dasehra and Madai
festivals, the practice of settling disputes and resolving problems
with the help of deities, and the accounts of the past given in the
anga dev communities.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1. Introduction: The Making of the

this study attempts to find a link between social class background
and the health lifestyles of Emory undergraduate students. Twenty
students, ten from lower social class backgrounds and ten from
higher social class backgrounds, were interviewed in-depth about
their childhood experiences, personal conceptions of health, and
current health lifestyles. Students from lower social class
backgrounds reported being raised in environments that neither
encouraged nor modeled healthy eating and exercising. Respondents
from higher social class backgrounds tended to recall their parents
modeling and encouraging healthy eating and regular exercise.
However, once each group of students matriculated to college, they
were likely to adopt the opposing health lifestyle. Students from
lower social class backgrounds often began eating healthily and
exercising, while students from higher social class backgrounds
frequently neglected to exercise regularly or maintain a balanced
diet. The majority of students from both social class backgrounds
spoke about ""the college lifestyle"" - a subculture that represents
a break from the ""real world"" and promotes and normalizes rampant
alcohol and drug use - as a major barrier to attaining an optimal
level of health. Future research should serve to illuminate the
patterns I have found in greater depth. The concept of ""the college
lifestyle"" as a subculture with its own set of norms that imply a
barrier to health should be investigated in detail.","Introduction 1 -- Theoretical Background 3 -- Bourdieu and Cultural

Reconstructing Habeas: Towards a New Emergency Scheme
By Christina Yang
When an attack hits far too close to home, and an entire nation
is left gasping in its sudden, violent wake, there is a collective
feeling that something has changed. People begin to wonder: Are we
safe? Even as we are brought closer together by the common bond of
tragedy, we become hyper-vigilant and hyper-paranoid. Eager,
competitive politicians become embroiled in a national security rat
race, each looking to one up the other on ""toughness."" Soon enough,
increasingly repressive policies are written into law - each
promising greater security for the nation. Sacrifices, they say,
are both necessary and expected in crises. These are not ordinary
times, but extraordinary times. Yet what is too often waylaid in
such exigent times?
Liberty. Rights. All those things we value both in the abstract
and in the everyday are somehow lost in the wartime scramble,
somehow made insignificant, amidst all the panic, anger, and
confusion. The United States, however, is not an authoritarian
government. America is a country that values liberty. Liberty is a
big part of who we are as Americans - both at home and abroad. So
when we sacrifice our liberties, when we fill the value of liberty
with air instead of substance when balanced against security, we
forget that America was founded on an idea, a vision of freedom, of
rule by democracy and respect of law, and that the idea is only
good, meaningful, and valuable insofar as it is practiced.
So the question we ask ourselves must not be ""When do we value
liberty enough to interfere with security,"" but ""When do we value
security enough to interfere with liberty?"" Unfortunately, this is
not an easy question to answer - nor is it a question which
possesses only one ""correct"" solution. In this paper, however, I
postulate a better solution than what has been offered thus far by
arguing for the writ of habeas corpus - i.e., the Suspension Clause
- to be set as the absolute minimum in exigent times.","Table of Contents -- Introduction -- Chapter 1: Setting the Stage

Paradise Ablaze:
Cavendish's Feminist Utopias and the Deconstruction of Gender

This study sets out to explore how early modern author Margaret
Cavendish used her writings
to offer a bold feminist statement that reconfigured
seventeenth-­‐century notions of gender. I
base my argument on three primary texts: Bel in Campo
(1662), The Convent of Pleasure (1668), and The
Description of a New World cal ed the Blazing New World (1666).
I argue that
Cavendish uses ""gender blending"" to fashion a feminist statement
that deconstructs her era's
gender binary and its associated gendered hierarchy. Through this
deconstruction, she uses her
works as gender transgressive spaces that enable women to enter the
public sphere.","Table of Contents -- List of Abbreviations: . . . . . . . . . . . .

phosphorylation of a number of clinically important nucleoside
analog (NA) prodrugs in addition to its natural substrates,
2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, and 2'-deoxyadenosine. To
improve the catalytic activity and tailor the substrate specificity
of dCK, libraries of mutant enzymes were constructed and tested for
thymidine kinase activity. Random and site-saturation mutagenesis
were employed to probe for residue positions with an impact on
substrate specificity, identifying positions Arg104 and Asp133 in
the active site as key residues for substrate specificity. The
results illuminate the key contributions of these two amino acids
to enzyme function by demonstrating their ability to moderate
substrate specificity. Clinically relevant NAs mostly differ from
their endogenous counterparts in respect to various modifications
at the ribose moiety. To determine the molecular aspects of
modified ribose binding, site-saturation mutagenesis was utilized
at six amino acid positions in the active site of dCK. All the
library members were evaluated by an in vivo screening to
find a variant with improved turnover rate for AZT. Kinetic
analysis of the selected mutants indicates that the enhanced AZT
activity could not be fulfilled with the chosen methodology.
Therefore, novel screening methods with positive selection should
be developed for further engineering with improved NA
phosphorylation. Besides the active site residues, there are other
structural elements in the dCK structure that determines the
substrate specificity. To test this hypothesis, chimeragenesis was
utilized using dCK and the C-terminal region of Dm-dNK to
probe the role of phosphoryl donor binding loop in regards to
phosphoryl donor and acceptor specificity in dCK. Kinetic analysis
of the chimeras indicates that the phosphoryl donor preference was
reversed from UTP to ATP as a result of swapped subdomains from
Dm-dNK. In order to further investigate the function of
donor base-sensing loop, two specific amino acid positions Asp241
and Phe242 were selected for alanine scanning mutagenesis in dCK.
The results elucidate the sequence dependency of phosphoryl donor
preference and the structure-function relationship in this small
phosphoryl donor binding loop region.","Chapter 1 General

Community Influences on Sexual Risk Taking Behavior among Youth in
Bolivia and the
Dominican Republic
By Sarah D. Gilman and Rob Stephenson, PhD
Objectives: This analysis examined the role of
community-level factors on risky sexual
behaviors among young people aged 15 to 24 years in Bolivia and the
Dominican Republic
(DR).
Methods: Demographic and health survey data from Bolivia
(2003) and the DR (2007) was
analyzed to identify individual and community level factors
associated with reports of risky
sexual behaviors.
Results: The pathways through which the community
environment affected sexual behaviors
varied by gender, country and outcome. The community environment
plays an important role in
shaping risky sexual behavior among youth. Marital status, parity
and ethnicity of surrounding
communities were strong influences on youth sexual behavior.
Conclusions: These results provide support for a focus on
community-level influences as an
intervention point for behavioral change. However, interventions
should recognize culture and
context specific pathways through which the community can shape the
sexual behaviors of
youth.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1:

Bayesian Techniques","Infectious disease models attempt to evaluate the effects on the
spread and trans-
mission of disease. One particular model, the
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)
model, places individuals into classes of disease progression,
where a series of dif-
ferential equations tracks the rates of transmission and recovery
for a given disease
through a susceptible population. Two parameters, the transmission
parameter and
the recovery parameter, drive the dynamics of the model, and their
ratio, R0, is the
average number of cases caused by one infectious individual within
a completely sus-
ceptible population. R0 is seen as one of the most important
quantities in the study of
epidemics, and signals how quickly a particular disease can spread
amongst a suscep-
tible population. Previous analyses have focused primarily on
tracking these epidemic
disease parameters over time, and classifying individuals due to
baseline differences
which reflect heterogeneity within the population. For example,
these differences can
be based on age, gender, vaccination status, or behavior.

However, we choose to quantify the spatial heterogeneity that
exists in spatially-
referenced data in an effort to define core areas of disease rates
and transmission.
We first consider geographically weighted regression (GWR) models
in an effort to
assess the spatial variability that exists between disease rates
and baseline tract-
level characteristics which can define core disease areas. Next, we
build hierarchical
Bayesian models which incorporate random effects structures,
inducing correlation
in local estimates of disease transmission with exchangeable random
effects, which
smooth local estimates based on global averages, and conditionally
autoregressive
(CAR) random effects, which smooth local estimates based on
neighboring estimates.
We extend a chain binomial model to predict the spread of disease,
while considering
two different parameterizations of the chain binomial model, and
simulate outbreaks
to assess model performance. In addition, we extend a general
epidemic model, which
incorporates aspects of frailty models in assessing heterogeneity
within the popula-
tion. Through our modeling approaches, we are able to identify
cores areas for the
transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in

We investigate the miscibility and the phase separation temperature
Ts of a miscible
polymer blend polystyrene (PS) /poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME). We
have developed a
fluorescence technique to measure Ts with the ultimate goal
of finding the effect of electric fields
on the miscibility of polymer blends. In developing this
fluorescence method, we discuss the
effects of different fluorophores, the sensitivity of the blend to
moisture, and the correlation
between reproducibility and the fluorescently labeled PS content.
Based on these findings, we
find a substantial difference in Ts between samples cast on
clear quartz slides and on ITO-coated
slides. Even though Ts under the presence of electric fields
was not attained within the time limit,
this study has laid the groundwork for continuing florescence
studies on the effect of electric
fields on the miscibility of PS/PVME blends.","Table of Contents -- I. Introduction 1 -- Miscibility of Polymers

migrants have been identified as a vulnerable population for HIV

cited as a factor for HIV infection. Higher rates of HIV in Mexico
have been linked to Mexican returning-

condom use among migrants are not
well defined. Social networks and peer effects have been shown to
significantly improve health-related
behaviors. The aim of this study was to understand the association
between peer influences
and condom use among Mexican migrants to the US, migrants who had
returned to Mexico from the US
and men who had never migrated. The data for this study were
obtained from a mixed
methods data collection study looking at different aspects of
Mexican-migrant and non-migrant health

was conducted to identify factors of
interest associated with condom use. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis was used to create two

3.00, 18.87), and peer's advise
about condom use (OR= 3.57, CI= 1.46, 8.72) were significant
predictors of condom use during last sex.
This study suggests that peer influences may impact condom use and
that this may partially
explain the differences previously reported in condom use between
Mexican migrant and non-migrant
populations. Understanding the role of social networks among
migrant and Mexican non-migrant
populations may allow the design of novel effective and
comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention
interventions.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1.

The Relation of Cannabis and Alcohol Use with Cortisol and Symptom
Severity in Youth At-
Risk for Psychosis
By Sara M. Feldman
Approximately half of the patients suffering from schizophrenia
have a lifetime comorbid
substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis. Substance use among
psychotic patients is twice the
rate of use among healthy controls in the general population. SUDs
in schizophrenic patients are
associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Research shows that 25 to
45% of individuals who
meet criteria for the prodrome to schizophrenia convert to a
full-blown psychotic disorder within
2 to 5 years. Further, individuals who meet prodromal criteria are
increasingly likely to convert
to a psychotic disorder if they use cannabis. Experimental studies
where Delta-9-THC was
administered show acute increases in cortisol levels. The present
study examined the relation of
alcohol (AU) and cannabis use (CU) with cortisol levels and
symptoms in 33 healthy controls, 56
prodromal patients, and 40 psychiatric controls. The current study
hypothesized that prodromal
subjects who report CU will show elevated cortisol levels, as well
as more severe positive
symptoms. The present study indicated no relation of AU with
cortisol levels, symptoms, or
conversion to psychosis. Further, the findings indicated that CU
was not associated with
symptom severity or progression. However, CU was linked with
reduced cortisol levels. The
results are interpreted in light of past findings indicating that
youth with lower baseline cortisol
levels are more likely to become cannabis users in the future, and
that longer term CU is linked
with reduced cortisol levels. Thus, although CU results in an acute
increase in cortisol and
positive symptoms, initial CU and prolonged CU appears to be
associated with lower cortisol
levels.","Table of Contents --

The present dissertation evaluated whether an alternative comorbid ADHD phenotype increases the external validity over and above the extant DSM-IV diagnostic subtypes by identifying more homogeneous conditions genetically and with regard to sex, age, and overlapping disorders. The sample included 372 children (ages 5 - 18) who were recruited as part of an ongoing study on the genetics of ADHD. Probands, their siblings, and parents were genotyped for a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in exon 3 of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) and an insertion / deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). Planned comparisons revealed that the Combined subtype is characterized by a higher proportion of males, lower mean age, and higher symptom levels of oppositional defiant and conduct disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders compared with the Inattentive or Hyperactive-Impulsive subtypes. Genetic association analyses suggested that the DRD4 7-repeat allele is more strongly related to the Combined and Inattentive subtypes than the Hyperactive-Impulsive subtype, whereas the 5-HTTLPR long allele is more strongly related to the Inattentive subtype compared with the other two subtypes. Furthermore, there was evidence suggesting that co-occurring symptoms of conduct disorder (CD) moderated the ADHD-DRD4 relation, such that the association between ADHD and DRD4 was stronger in children with both ADHD and elevated CD symptoms. There was also evidence of a moderating influence of co-occurring symptoms of anxiety, whereby the association between ADHD and 5-HTTLPR was stronger in children with higher levels of anxiety. In contrast, there was no significant evidence of association between the overall ADHD diagnosis and the DRD4 7-repeat allele or the 5-HTTLPR long allele. These findings suggest that when testing a phenotypically heterogeneous condition such as ADHD, undertaking subgroup analyses (i.e., examining either diagnostic subtypes or comorbid subgroups of ADHD) or incorporating continuous measures of overlapping psychopathology as moderators can be a useful strategy for enhancing external validity and our ability to detect genetic associations that might be otherwise obscured.","General

The Role of Acute Pain in the Elicitation of Empathy
By Allison E. Meyer
Empathy is the capacity to understand vicariously the physical or
emotional or emotional
experiences of another person and is crucial to human
relationships. It comprises three
components: an affective response, cognitive perspective-taking and
regulation of vicarious
emotion. A high degree of empathy for others' pain may result in
pain for oneself, and evidence
suggests that the affective component of empathy may be related to
pain at a neural level. It was
hypothesized that participants assigned to the pain condition would
report stronger feelings of
empathy for another person than those assigned to the control
condition. It was also hypothesized
that dispositional empathy and emotion regulation skills would
relate to reports of state empathy
and personal distress. To test these hypotheses, adult females (n =
30) were randomly assigned to
either the pain or no-pain condition. Pain was induced using the
cold pressor task, in which
participants are asked to submerge their hand in a cold-water bath
for thirty seconds after they
first report feeling pain. After participating in the experimental
conditions, the participants
viewed a brief video clip of a character experiencing physical
pain, all participants reported
feelings of empathy and personal distress. Results did not support
the hypotheses. There were no
significant differences in empathy between condition, and
participants assigned to the pain
condition reported significantly lower levels of personal distress.
Regression analyses did not
provide support for the notion that dispositional empathy or
emotion regulation skills impact
state empathy or level of personal distress following participation
in the experimental conditions.
Attention processes may account for the differences in personal
distress across the conditions.
Findings, study limitations, and implications are discussed.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Methods 8 -- Results 12 --

effect on childhood development could have a substantial population
impact. Studies examining the association between obesity and
development have produced inconsistent results and have been
conducted primarily in older children. This dissertation explores
the association between early childhood obesity and: cognitive
ability; adaptive functioning; behavior; and executive
functioning.
The first study assessed the extent to which body mass
index (BMI), triceps- and subscapular-skinfold-thickness (TST, SST)
differed in their classification of obesity status. This analysis
used data from the Follow-Up Development and Growth
Experiences (FUDGE) Study, a population of preschool-aged
Atlanta children born at one of two Atlanta hospitals.
Results demonstrated that agreement among obesity metrics was
typically poor and the picture of childhood obesity can change
depending on the population. The degree to which differences among
metrics exists depends on the population.
The second study explored the association of early childhood
overweight/obesity and cognitive ability by using data from FUDGE
Study participants to assess the relationship of overweight/obesity
with scores on the Differential Ability Scales (DAS). The study
then used data from participants in the US Collaborative Perinatal
Project (CPP) to examine the association between BMI at ages 3, 4,
and 7 years and scores on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales
and Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children. Results from the
FUDGE Study found that overweight/obesity was associated with
declines in nonverbal cognitive ability in preschool-aged boys;
though not among girls. Analysis of CPP data indicated no
association between either overweight or obesity and cognitive
outcomes.
The third study used data from the FUDGE Study to explore the
association of early childhood obesity with adaptive functioning,
behavior, and executive functioning. Results indicated that
overweight/obesity was associated with declines in motor skills
scores among boys (with no corresponding association in girls) and
in statue scores among girls of higher socioeconomic status.
Taken together, these studies found little evidence for an
association between overweight/obesity and development. However,
results indicate possible associations of overweight/obesity with
nonverbal cognitive ability and motor skills in boys and NEPSY
statue score in girls of higher SES.","-- Table of Contents -- 1. INTRODUCTION.. 1 --

palliative care study recruitment, and then use data from the
Impact of Hospital-Based Chaplain Support on Decision-Making During

(PCCS) study to investigate whether friend and family presence is
associated with palliative care study consent.
There were 325 patients who consented or
declined to consent to a second part of the PCCS study and were
included in this analysis. The patients included in the study had
an average of 1.3 diaries per patient before consent decision (423
diaries in total). The exposure of interest was presence of family
and friends during chaplain encounters, and was analyzed two ways:
as â€˜ever' or â€˜never,' and as
percentage of encounters where family or friends were present. The
exposure variable in the model with the binary
â€˜ever' or â€˜never' coding for
family or friend presence was not significant. The model analyzing
the proportion of encounters where family or friends were present
found a significant 40% decrease in the likelihood of consent for
patients who had family and friends present at all PCCS diary
encounters compared to patients with family and friends present at
none of the PCCS diary encounters. The results indicate that family
and friend presence is associated with palliative care study
recruitment.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

generally perceived, but not actual, value similarity is important
for maintaining low conflict and high depth within friendships.
Friendship quality generally did not differ by attachment style,
but there were two interactions suggesting that attachment style
moderates the relationship between value similarity and friendship
quality. This study concluded that perceived value similarity is
important for high-quality friendships, and that although
friendships typically are not attachment relationships, attachment
style may still impact friendship functioning.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Friendship as an Attachment

Femininity in Urban China","A shengnü is a woman of marriage age who is not yet
married. This project examines the emerging phenomenon of the
shengnü in modern Chinese society. It discusses the
extent to which changing perspectives of femininity have influenced
the spread of these ""leftover women"" throughout China's cities,
particularly after the end of the Mao era. It suggests that in the
years following the Cultural Revolution and China's reform period,
patterns of traditional gender roles began to reemerge. Many women
found great difficulty in reconciling these gender roles with the
notions of equality spread throughout the Cultural Revolution and
the newfound financial independence achieved through the
institution of economic reforms. It argues that when women choose a
balance between career and traditional femininity that potential
romantic partners deem improper, these women are unable to find a
husband, and thus become shengnü. It
investigates the nuances of the term, and different models of women
who, for various reasons, have become
shengnü.
In the second half, it examines the ways in which these women
are depicted in popular media. It uses two specific examples, one
episode of the reality dating show, Fei Cheng Wu Rao and a
movie, Taohua Yun to discuss the portrayal of single women
in urban China. It concludes that Fei Cheng Wu Rao makes the
term shengnü look like a much more negative and passive
moniker than the contestants on the show seem to embody. With
regard to Taohua Yun, it examines the film's ambiguities to
uncover its subtle message that a woman's self identity is shaped
by her relationships with the men in her life. That these two
examples are in seeming opposition with one another leads to the
idea that the definitions of and reactions to varying types of
femininity are constantly in flux. All in all, this thesis
concludes that because notions of womanliness, as well as the ways
in which members of society react to these different notions, are
constantly changing, the shengnü has emerged as a
manifestation of women's difficulties in trying to embody all of
these types of femininity without deterring potential mates.","Introduction..........................................................................................

Culture of the Academic Library
","What does it mean, when academic libraries are noisy? After
centuries of silence, bound up in architecture, building use
policies, and scholarly habits, the American academic library is
experiencing abrupt changes in its soundscape as shifts in
technology and pedagogy prompt its re-situation in the academic
community. Librarians, facing a future in which the role and
relevancy of the library is uncertain, argue for its continued
validity by linking changes in the library to its educational
mission and to the needs and preferences of students born in the
Digital Age. Lifelong library users, though acquiescing to these
changes, question their appropriateness to the library's essential
role. Conflicts over the meaning of the academic library bespeak
broader challenges in American higher education over balancing
support for the life of the mind with the demands of a
consumer-driven academic culture.
Focused on American academic libraries in general and Emory
University's Woodruff Library in particular, this phenomenological
and ethnographic case study explores the meaning of the library to
members of the academic community as a way of assessing the
legitimacy of new library spaces. Using theories of discourse and
sociological theories of legitimacy, methods of cultural and
linguistic anthropology, and a historical and experiential focus on
the soundscape of the library, this interdisciplinary research
gauges the divergence between users' beliefs about and use of the
library and the types of spaces and activities promoted by
librarians. In discourse about and observations within libraries,
differing expectations of the role of the library emerge, along
with a process of legitimating new library spaces by connecting
them to broader cultural frameworks and extant beliefs regarding
the role of the library. Beyond evidencing the library's expanding
technological and pedagogical roles, the soundscape of the academic
library signals a deeper shift in the nature of academic life -
from the culture of isolated reflection that has long typified the
life of the mind, to a new academic culture of productivity, in
which a focus on efficiency, outcomes, and consumer demands drive
the experience of higher education.","CHAPTER 1 THE SOUND OF CHANGE IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES 1 -- STATEMENT

""Holding down the Fort?"" The War Historical
Cooperation of the U.S. Army and
Former German Wehrmacht Officers,
1945-1961
By Esther-Julia Krug
In July 1945 the U.S. War Department sent a special historical
interrogation mission to
Europe to interview high-ranking German prisoners of war with the
goal to achieve a
more accurate understanding of the war and the circumstances
leading up to it. After this
so-called Shuster Commission finished its work, the U.S. Army's
Historical Section in the
European Theater of Operations (ETO) picked up the idea and in
January 1946 created
the Operational History (German) Section to organize and oversee
the interrogation of
hundreds of high-ranking German officers and General Staff
officers. Soon, the Germans
not only answered questionnaires, but also received specific topics
to compile historical
studies on their own. Released from their prisoner of war and
civilian internee status
respectively in 1947 and 1948, many continued to work for the U.S.
Army from their
homes as civilian employees. Against the background of increasing
tensions between the
United States and the Soviet Union the U.S. military soon found a
particular interest in
the German officers' first-hand experience with the Soviet Union in
general and the Red
Army specifically. Until 1961, this remarkable cooperation produced
more than 2,500
military studies on a variety of strategic, tactical, technical,
and military-political
questions, at times involving over 600 former German
officers.
This thesis attempts to trace the origins and the organizational
development of this
remarkable cooperation between the U.S. Army and former German
Wehrmacht officers.
Moreover, it raises questions for specific goals and agendas, which
the U.S. Army as well
as the German participants associated with the project. The thesis
examines the specific
character of the relationships between German and American officers
and how these
developed and changed over the course of their cooperation. The
analysis of the German-
American history project also sheds light on transnational aspects
of a selective exposure
to war memory, its ideological spin and political exploitation, and
the parameters of the
postwar and emerging Cold War mentality in both West Germany and
the United States.","Table of Contents -- I) Introduction 1 -- 1. The Topic -- A

Three Essays in Environmental and Resource Economics
This dissertation studies three important and timely topics related
to the use of
natural resources and the generation of pollutants. Chapter One
explores the impact
that state water management frameworks have on farm productivity.
Prior
appropriation law states allow greater access to surface waters for
use in irrigation, a
critical input for crops. I find that states operating under this
form of water law have
corn yields that are approximately 20 to 30 bushels per acre higher
than their riparian
law counterparts. This represents an 18 to 28% increase on average.
Chapter Two
addresses to what extent oil producers respond to changes in price
and whether higher
royalties on oil production result in a reduction in the life of a
producing lease. By
exploiting a unique lease-level data set of monthly sales of oil
from leases on federal
properties, I estimate that production from the vast majority of
currently producing
leases is highly inelastic. Estimated elasticities are small and
generally not significantly
different than zero. This data set also includes data from the
fourteen-year period during
which marginal leases were granted royalty reductions by the Bureau
of Land
Management to stimulate production during periods of low price. The
most marginal of
this class of leases, those that do not report sales regularly,
have significantly higher
elasticities. Further, leases that participated in the royalty
reduction program had a 15%
lower probability of being shut-in than those leases that were not
eligible for the
program. Finally, Chapter Three investigates a novel method to
predict carbon dioxide
emissions from developing countries, the primary driver of
emissions growth over the past
decade. I employ an environmental Kuznets curve-type analysis to
predict emissions, but
rather than relating the level of per capita pollutant to a
country's gross domestic
product, I use a socio-economic status measure constructed from
household
characteristics and possessions survey data from developing
countries. This approach
improves on in-sample prediction of emissions which rely on gross
domestic product
alone, although data limitations prevent formal testing of this
conclusion.",

In Our Own Hands: Black Private Education in Chicago,
1940-1986
By Worth K. Hayes
This dissertation looks at the development of black private
education in Chicago from
1940 to 1986. By black private education, this study refers to
schools that not only served a
majority black student population but were also created, operated,
and staffed by blacks. The
dissertation focuses even more specifically on black private
schools that taught kindergarten to
8th grade. This topic area remains neglected despite the steady
growth of African-American
enrollment in private schools throughout the 20th century. A
history of black private schools
illuminates the appeal of educational alternatives to
African-Americans. This work also provides
scholars with a unique window to African-American educational
interests not seen in most
studies of public education. This dissertation identifies the
distinctive educational philosophies,
curriculum, and pedagogy blacks developed in their own institutions
within the context of the
history of African Americans nationally and regionally.

Annulation-Demetalation Cascade","Abstract
Due to their versatility, π-allylmolybdenum complexes have
become common
organometallic enantiomeric scaffolds for the construction of a
variety of natural- and
non-natural biologically important heterocyclic compounds.
Recently, the Liebeskind
group has developed a concise, high throughput methodology that is
based on oxo- and
aza-Achmatowicz reactions, to access both racemic and enantiopure
TpMo(CO)2(η3-
pyranyl) and TpMo(CO)2(η3-pyridinyl) scaffolds respectively.
To probe the use of
Achmatowicz reaction in the synthesis of substituted scaffolds and
for greater synthetic
versatility, 3-methyl substituted TpMo(CO)2(η3-pyranyl)
organometallic scaffold has
been prepared.
The direct nucleophilic functionalization of charge neutral
TpMo(CO)2(η3-
pyranyl) and TpMo(CO)2(η3-pyridinyl) complexes complement the
nucleophilic
functionalization of cationic, highly electrophilic molybdenum
complexes. The 3-methyl
substituted TpMo(CO)2(η3-pyranyl) scaffold underwent an
uncatalyzed Friedel-Crafts-
like direct nucleophilic functionalization with silyl enol ether to
form a 2,3-disubstituted
η3-allylmolybdenum complex. In addition, 2,3-disubstituted
η3-allylmolybdenum
complexes were obtained in modest yields by addition of
organometallic reagents to a
cationic molybdenum complex.
Mild and efficient demetalation of η3-allymolybdenum complexes
is a key step to
convert the intermediate into useful organic compounds. Expanding
the scope of
annulative demetalation of η3-allymolybdenum to
2,3-disubstituted η3-allylmolybdenum
complexes led to the formation of a quaternary center at the ring
junction of cis-fused
heterocyclic ring system.

Behavior and Social Networks in Sub-Saharan Africa","The tempo of Middle and Late Stone Age behavioral change in Africa
is integral to understanding the evolution of our species.
Environmental change has been implicated in the technological
changes, migratory routes and subsistence patterns that
characterize the transition from the Middle to Late Stone Ages.
However, we need more complete climatic and environmental data for
individual archaeological sites relevant to this interval in order
to understand the links between ecology and behavior. This study
tests the hypothesis that local climatic and environmental records
provide a higher-resolution and locally distinct reconstruction
than existing regional proxies in understanding the complex
relationship between environment, behavior, and demography.
Paleoenvironments at six study sites spanning this time period
(Omo-Kibish and Porc Epic, Ethiopia; Lukenya Hill, Kenya; Kalemba
and Makwe Caves, Zambia; Sibudu Cave, South Africa) were
reconstructed through carbon and oxygen isotopic characterization
and zooarchaeological analysis of fossil tooth enamel of faunal
communities. The main results suggest that the Last Glacial Maximum
was the most significant continent level event in Africa during the
late Pleistocene. Most study sites reflect a rapid shift towards
greater aridity from the pre-Last Glacial to the Last Glacial time
period. However, Omo-Kibish and Porc Epic may actually have become
slightly less arid during the Last Glacial Maximum. In Zambia, a
concurrent transition to C3 grasslands is indicated by carbon
isotopic profiles of traditional grazers, particularly equids. Such
a transition is not interpreted from the data for sites in Kenya or
Ethiopia, suggesting that human groups in southern Africa may have
experienced more extreme shifts in local climate. High-resolution
environmental data allows for a greater appreciation of the
microeconomic forces influencing behavior. Aridification of
southern Africa during the Last Glacial may have had a major impact
on migration and population change, altering population
distributions and densities. Ethiopia with its relatively dry, but
stable, environment throughout the late Pleistocene may have been a
refugia for human groups and a cul-de-sac in terms of migrations
out of Africa. Results of this study provide a more complete
picture of regional environmental diversity for contextualizing
local habitats in which humans evolved across Africa.",

Microcredit Groups on Empowerment in Eastern Kenya","Background: Over 40% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population
lives on less than $1 a day,
and the region is at risk of not meeting any of the Millennium
Development Goal targets.1
For the past 40 years, microfinance has been heralded as a solution
to poverty, a means of
empowerment, and a way to directly improve health outcomes.
However, there is little
published research that has examined the effect of microfinance on
empowerment in an
African context.
Objectives: This research will examine how women's
involvement in Vinya Wa Aka, a
unique microcredit group in Eastern Kenya, influences empowerment
as a process and
outcome. This research seeks to address the gap in literature on
empowerment and
microcredit in Kenya.
Methods: This study uses a case study approach with two
groups of participants, VWA
founders and trainees. A total of 24 in-depth interviews were
conducted in 5 study sites in
Nairobi and Eastern Province, Kenya. Participants were selected
based on differential
length of involvement, residence, and income-generating activities.
Grounded theory
guided data collection and analysis, with comparison and
conceptualization being used
extensively. Participant observations were also conducted during
social and business
meetings with VWA founders.
Results: Money plays a complex role in the groups'
empowerment, yet it was reported as
one of the least important benefits of involvement with VWA. There
was a clear, cyclical
process of ""enlightenment"" and empowerment that occurred in the
trainee groups due to
their involvement with VWA. ""Enlightenment"" consisted of trainings,
where participants
were ""exposed"" to new ideas and ""woken up"" to the possibilities
that this unique model
could provide. Participants were empowered through ""moving up""
financially and
socially, achieving security in the group, and finally, feeling
stable enough to ""move
forward"" and help other groups achieve empowerment, thus continuing
the cycle.
Discussion: In public health discourse, ""empowerment"" is
often proxy for development,
increasing women's status, and improving women's health outcomes.
This research
provides the process by which women in this microcredit group begin
to achieve such
empowerment, which de-emphasizes monetary inputs, and which may
prove useful to
donors and others engaged in public health work in Kenya.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

SITUATIONAL AWARENESS, AND DECISION MAKING SUPPORT","ABSTRACT
Disease surveillance and population health monitoring
represents one of the cornerstones of public health surveillance,
early disease identification and prevention, and situational
awareness. Constant monitoring for potential emerging public health
threats is one of the most important missions of public health.
Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection,
analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data regarding a
health related event for use is public health actions to reduce
morbidity and mortality and to improve health. Early detection of a
new outbreak and rapid response to a public health threat could
result in saving of millions of lives but also great financial
savings from preventing hospitalizations, deaths and all the
socio-economic effects associated with it. In order to provide
early disease detection and situational awareness, different public
health surveillance systems were developed that monitor population
health and report different public health events and threats. These
systems perform different functions and can be classified in three
different categories: i) syndromic surveillance systems, ii)
laboratory surveillance systems, iii) web-based public health
surveillance systems. All of these systems have significant
contributions in early disease detection and monitoring,
situational awareness, and decision making support. In this study
we provided an overview of major public health surveillance systems
for syndromic surveillance including BioSense, ESSENCE, and ILINet,
laboratory surveillance including NNDSS, FoodNet, and eHARS, and
web-bases surveillance including HealthMap, ProMED-mail, and
BioCaster. We provided a summary of the different functionalities
each system offers and supports as well as limitations associated
with each system. Finally, we identified challenges in public
health surveillance systems and we proposed potential tools and
surveillance models that could be used to improve data collection,
analysis, and reporting and enhance the functionality of public
health surveillance systems.","Table of Contents -- CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH

second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. Preventive
approaches aimed at specific, known pathways of CRC causation, such
as oxidative stress, might be effective in reducing CRC morbidity
and mortality. Although oxidative stress is implicated in
colorectal carcinogenesis, human studies that evaluated
associations of individual pro- and antioxidants with CRC have been
inconclusive. The goals for this dissertation were to
develop, compare and evaluate comprehensive ""oxidative balance
scores (OBS)"", comprised of individual dietary, and environmental
exposures that are known to affect physiologic oxidative processes,
and to investigate the association of oxidative balance with risk
of colorectal neoplasms and biomarkers of oxidative
stress.
Four OBS were created to reflect combined summary measures of
dietary and non-dietary anti- and pro-oxidant exposures. A higher
score represents a predominance of anti- over pro-oxidant
exposures. In a pooled analysis of three colonoscopy-based
case-control studies, a substantial, statistically significant
lower risk of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas was found with
higher levels of OBS. The results also suggested a dose dependent
decrease in F2-isoprostanes, a sensitive and specific marker of
oxidative stress in vivo, with increasing levels of OBS,
providing support for OBS as a valid measure of oxidative balance.
In a large prospective cohort study, higher OBS were associated
with lower risk of CRC. In a biomarker-based pooled analysis of two
case-control studies of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas,
results suggested that lipid peroxidation, as indicated by
circulating F2-isoprostanes, may be 1) positively associated with
risk for incident, sporadic colorectal adenoma in women, but not
men, and 2) inversely associated with antioxidant micronutrient
exposures, with some differences according to sex.
In conclusion, I introduced three novel methods for constructing
OBS in this dissertation. Results of this dissertation support the
use of pathway exposure scores to measure complex multicomponent
exposures, provide evidence to suggest that oxidative balance is
strongly associated with colorectal adenoma and cancer incidence,
and support further investigations of oxidative balance with other
chronic diseases. My dissertation also provides a framework for the
development of oxidative balance-based interventions to reduce
colorectal cancer risk.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- ILLUSTRATIONS -- LIST OF TABLES -- CHAPTER 1.

performance on Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests (CRCT) among
1st Grade students in Georgia","Background: Smoking during pregnancy has been reported to be
associated with poorer
cognitive function test scores. The objective of this study is to
assess whether maternal smoking
during pregnancy is associated with poorer performance on
Criterion-Referenced Competency
Tests (CRCT) among 1st Grade students in Georgia.
Methods: This study is a retrospective cohort study, in
which electronic birth certificates of
children born to Georgia resident mothers from 1998 to 2003 were
deterministically linked with
individual CRCT educational records taken from 2004 to 2010, for
students of Grade 1 in
Georgia. Maternal smoking during pregnancy, the exposure variable,
was recorded on birth
certificates. Binary fail/pass levels for CRCT Reading, Reading,
English/Language Arts (ELA)
and Mathematics tests were defined using standardized scaled
scores. The pass/fail levels were
the dependent variables in logistic and log-binomial models, with
adjustment for maternal age at
the time of birth; alcohol consumption during pregnancy; marital
status; maternal education;
prenatal care status; delivery funded by Medicaid or not; whether
having prior adverse birth
outcomes; child's sex; race/ethnicity; whether being preterm birth;
low birth weight; small for
gestational age; and parity status.
Results: In models adjusted for maternal and child
characteristics, maternal smoking during
pregnancy compared to non-smoking was associated with an increased
risk of poor school
performance. The risk ratios were 1.17 (1.13-1.21) for Reading
test, 1.13 (1.10-1.16) for ELA test
and 1.14 (1.10-1.17) for Mathematics test. These risk ratios
remained statistically significant
when we further adjusted for smoking-related adverse birth
outcomes, including preterm birth,
low birth weight and small for gestational age. Our results also
indicated that for any CRCT test,
there was a dose-response relationship between maternal smoking
during pregnancy and the risk
of poor offspring school performance (p-value &lt; 0.001).
Conclusion: These results suggested that maternal smoking
during pregnancy may have long-
term effects on offspring school performance. Although the
association may not be causal, it
emphasizes the early preventive efforts health education and public
health campaigns about the
harmful effects of cigarette smoking by pregnant women.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- LIST OF TABLES

An Investigation into Managing SQL-Cardinality Constraints
By Lesi Wang
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) are commonly found in
practice and finding
effective representation language and efficient constraint solving
techniques are
important research areas. A recent development is the integration
of CSP (specifically
SAT) solvers with relational database systems to enable CSPs to be
modeled using SQL,
and solved within the database system. A key challenge in this
integration is to keep the
SAT encoding of SQL constraints small. In this work, we describe a
divide-and-conquer
technique for reducing the encoding of cardinality constraints. We
present a number of
experiments to show the improvements on performance.","Contents -- 1 Introduction 1 -- 2 Background 6 -- 2.1 System

Relevance to neurodegeneration","Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous
system. In the healthy brain, microglia continuously survey the
parenchyma to maintain homeostasis. When a disturbance is detected,
microglial processes migrate toward the site of injury and surround
it to help with tissue repair in a process that depends on ATP
release and activation of P2Y12 receptors on microglia.
However, in prolonged injury and in many neurodegenerative
conditions microglia assume an amoeboid ""activated"" phenotype
commonly associated with release of pro-inflammatory factors.
Microglial activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in
vitro results in P2Y12 receptor
downregulation, concurrent adenosine A2A receptor
upregulation, and ATP- and adenosine-induced process retraction
(rather than extension). The work presented here examines the
effects of A2A receptor activation under
pro-inflammatory conditions in acute brain slices and in
vivo with emphasis on the response of microglia to
tissue damage. Time-lapse confocal microscopy showed that activated
microglia in slices from LPS-treated
CX3CR1GFP/+ mice, which
have microglia-specific GFP expression, displayed reduced process
displacement in the direction of mechanically induced tissue
injury. Similar results were seen in slices prepared from the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of
Parkinson's disease. Consistent with the in
situ observations, microglia in LPS-treated
CX3CR1GFP/+ mice imaged
with in vivo two-photon microscopy showed a
delayed response to a laser-induced localized tissue damage. The
involvement of A2A receptors in modulating the delayed
response to damage was confirmed with the use of the selective
adenosine A2A receptor antagonist preladenant. Finally,
the effects of norepinephrine receptor activation in microglia were
characterized to determine if the purinergic (ATP/adenosine)
receptor system is unique among neurotransmitters in modulating
microglial motility. Application of norepinephrine to both resting
and LPS-activated primary microglia in vitro
resulted in process retraction. Interestingly, simultaneous
activation of adrenergic and purinergic receptors prevented
ATP-induced motility responses in microglia in
vitro, suggesting that norepinephrine might interfere
with the ability of microglia to respond to tissue damage
in vivo. The differential regulation of
microglial motility under resting and neuroinflammatory conditions
by various G protein-coupled receptors can have implications on
microglial ability to effectively respond to tissue disturbances
such as the extensive neuronal death in neurodegenerative
conditions.","--  --

PROTOTYPE","Background: As a
critical component of public health surveillance, public health
authorities disseminate alerts to healthcare providers to increase
their awareness of potential public health threats and to enable
timely and effective responses. The variety of communication
channels and the diversity of message formats, however, lead the
receptors to a paradoxical situation: too much useless information,
or too little relevant information. To address these challenges,
the CDC EMR alerting team developed a Public Health Alert
Repository System, and planned to conduct a real pilot to evaluate
its performance. A comprehensive evaluation plan was needed to
guarantee the completeness and validity of the test results.
Method: This
evaluation plan was designed by taking account of the objectives of
major stakeholders, selecting an evaluation framework, identifying
evaluation elements, and clarifying measurement methods.
Results: Based
on the logic model framework, stakeholders' objectives (actionable
alerts; consumption of alert; integration with the decision support
system; clinician action performed; sensitivity, specificity, and
PPV of matching algorithm; and local customization) were mapped
with five evaluation elements, including system
quality; quality of the alerts (sensitivity, PPV, and
specificity); clinician use of the alerts (""% of
matched alerts that are clicked""); user perception (a
user perception questionnaire); and impact (public
health impact: local customization; health care impact: ""% of
positive specimen stool results"" and ""number of specimen stools per
patient""). To test the validity of these indicators,
the plan also suggested calculating their correlations, including
the correlation between an objective indicator (% of matched alerts
that are clicked) and a subjective indicator (the score of the
""read alerts"" question), and the correlations between many input,
process, and outcome indicators.
Conclusion: In
this study, stakeholders' objectives were successfully translated
into a measurable evaluation matrix, where feasible measurement
methods, study design, and data resources were identified. The
causal relationships between input, process, and outcome, and the
correlations between objective indicators and subjective
indicators, were also recommended to be used for checking the
validity of many indicators. The development process of this
evaluation plan and many of its results may be possibly adapted for
other system evaluations.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I

Transporter Using Affinity Labeling and Mass
Spectrometry
","The small peptide PLFYM located in transmembrane domain two
(TM2) of the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) is suggested to be
the labeling site for the irreversible hDAT inhibitor
[125I] MFZ 2-24. To locate the [125I] MFZ
2-24 labeling site, hDAT was photolabeled with [125I]
MFZ 2-24 and digested with CNBr. The HPLC analysis of the digest
showed that one small peptide was labeled. Parnas et al. (2003)
demonstrated that [125I] MFZ 2-24 incorporates in
transmembrane domains 1 and 2 of hDAT. The possible peptides from
the CNBr digest include only two small hDAT peptides from the TM1-2
region, PLFYM and VIAGM, both in TM 2. The secondary enzymatic
digests of the small labeled peptide from the CNBr digest of hDAT
provided additional information supporting PLFYM being the labeled
peptide (Wirtz, 2004). To further locate the [125I] MFZ
2-24 labeling site, hDAT was photolabeled with [125I]
MFZ 2-24 and digested with thermolysin. The digest was separated on
HPLC and the fraction corresponding to the labeled peptide
collected. Edman degradation of the labeled peptide from the
thermolysin digest of hDAT suggested that the second amino acid
from the N-terminal was labeled, based on release of radioactivity.
Additionally, labeled peptide from a separate thermolysin digest
was re-digested with CNBr. The labeled peptide was analyzed by HPLC
before and after the CNBr digest. The retention time of the
[125I] MFZ 2-24 labeled peptide shifted, indicating that
the peptide has a methionine in the sequence. The results from the
CNBr and thermolysin digests in relation to the leucine transporter
crystal structure (Yamashita et al., 2005) suggest that PLFYM is
the labeled region, and F114 or Y115 are the labeled amino acid
residues.
The hDAT mass spectrometry coverage and detection limit were
examined using a ThermoFinnigan LTQ-FT high resolution mass
spectrometer. The peptides from a thermolysin digest were separated
on a nanoLC connected to a nanoelectrospray source. Mass
spectrometry detection of hDAT peptides from the thermolysin digest
resulted in 37 % coverage. The detected hDAT peptides were from the
N-,C-terminal regions and the loop regions. A smaller number of
peptides were also located in the transmembrane domain regions.
This result supports mass spectrometry studies of membrane proteins
that indicate the difficulties in detecting peptides from the
transmembrane regions of membrane proteins (Wu et al., 2007; Yates
et al., 2003). The detection limits for MFZ 2- 24 and for the
synthetic hDAT peptide FYMELAL were found to be 5 fmol and 10 fmol
respectively. Thus the 11.4 fmol of [125I] MFZ 2-24
labeled hDAT peptide left after in- gel digestion and extraction
steps of 100 plates of HEK cells is near the detection limit of the
instrument.",

ethnicity, and the making of Brazilian identities, 1924-1974","The arrival of tens of thousands of German-speakers to Brazil's
shores in the 19th and early 20th centuries
in part realized the dream of many among the intellectual and
political elite. They imagined German and other immigrants embody
cultural and eugenic traits that would help resolve a host of
Brazil's problems, from issues of land tenure to fears of racial
""degeneracy."" The immigrants themselves did as immigrants the world
over: forged communities and lifeways that drew on pre-migratory
experience while responding to and shaping their new contexts.
Tectonic shifts in politics and society during the 1930s and 40s
engendered reinterpretations of what constituted Brazilian
identity; a new and state-sponsored Brazilianness recast what had
previously been considered the nation's problems as its strengths.
Consequently, the various ethnicities that had arisen as a
consequence of mass European and Asian migrations--in particular,
Germans--emerged as an internal other, at once in Brazil but
dangerously not of Brazil. This presented German-Brazilians
with a radically altered landscape within which to assert both
national belonging and ethnic difference. However, within a
generation the ground had shifted again and Germanness reemerged
under the military dictatorship as one possible, idealized sort of
Brazilianness.
This dissertation traces the shifting meanings and
understandings of Germanness in Brazil at various junctures from
the 1924 centenary of German migrants' first arrival in southern
Brazil to the sesquicentenary celebrations in 1974. It demonstrates
the ways that various historical actors shaped Germanness as both a
set of traits and practices and as a rhetorical identity discourse.
In so doing, this dissertation reveals the stakes of ethnicity for
self-identifying German-Brazilians and for others. At various
historical junctures in mid-twentieth century Brazil, ethnicity
variously helped or hindered a host of diverse political
projects--most consequentially the consolidation of official
discourses of Brazilian identity. As this analysis demonstrates,
during the fifty years in question and in the minds of many
Brazilians, Germanness transitioned from a positive quality of a
national ""other"" to an existential internal threat to an idealized
aspect of Brazilianness.","Contents -- List of Tables -- List of Figures -- Introduction 1 --

Virus","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important
pathogen underlying acute lower respiratory tract infections in
infants. Currently there are no vaccines or antivirals.
Understanding the functions of RSV virulence genes should provide
new insights into development of vaccines and
antivirals.
Two non-structural genes of RSV (NS1 and NS2) suppress the
host immune responses. Deletion of either or both NS genes
generated virus that was either under-attenuated or over-attenuated
for an effective and safe vaccine candidate for infants and young
children. We used a codon deoptimization strategy to reduce the
expression of NS genes based on human codon usage bias, resulting
in dNSh virus. dNSh was attenuated in BEAS-2B and primary normal
human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface,
but not in Vero or HEp-2 cells. In BALB/c mice, dNSh exhibited
10-fold lower viral load yet induced higher levels of
RSV-neutralizing antibodies than the A2 non-deoptimized virus. Both
viruses induced the same protection efficacy against challenge
strains A/1997/12-35 and A2-line19F. Upon codon deoptimization, the
NS target protein, STAT2, was degraded to a lesser extent than
infection with non-deoptimized virus. dNSh induced less
NF-ÎºB activation, suggesting less pro-inflammatory
potential. Serial passages in BEAS-2B did not generate nucleotide
changes in the deoptimized regions.
    RSV strain differences are
an important factor in pathogenesis. The two surface glycoproteins,
attachment protein G and fusion protein F, play major functions
during infection. Previous studies indicated G protein was not
required for infection, based on the fact that G-null virus still
replicates efficiently in several cell-lines. We re-evaluated the
functions of the G gene for a clinical isolate A2001/2-20 (2-20) in
comparison to the lab strain A2. We generated recombinant viruses
containing G and F or no G protein from either A2 (kRSV-A2G-A2F and
kRSV-GstopA2F) or 2-20 strains (kRSV-2-20G-2-20F and
kRSV-Gstop2-20F). We quantified the contribution of G to virus
binding, entry kinetics, infectivity, and replication in
vitro. Removal of 2-20 G from the virus had more deleterious
effects than removal of A2 G in all the above processes. Overall,
the 2-20 strain F had a higher dependence on its G protein than did
the A2 strain.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION - AN OVERVIEW OF

of Breast Cancer in Austria","Objective: This study explores the relationship
between the perceived impact of cancer among long-term breast
cancer survivors, key socio-demographic and clinical variables, and
mental and physical health-related quality of life outcomes in
Austria.
Methods: One hundred and fifty-two long-term survivors of
breast cancer (on average 13 years after initial diagnosis)
completed three mailed surveys including the SF-36 to determine
self-reported mental and physical health functioning, the Impact of
Cancer (version 2) to assess the perceived positive and negative
aspects of long-term cancer survivorship, and a general
questionnaire to gather socio-demographic and clinical variables of
respondents. Linear regression models were constructed to determine
the various effects of the perceived positive and negative impact
of cancer, while controlling for additional socio-demographic and
clinical variables, on mental and physical health-related quality
of life.
Results: Respondents reported a physical health status
that centered on population norms for Austria, but scored lower on
mental health status. After controlling for age, chemotherapy,
exercise, and BMI, the positive impact of cancer was associated
with improved physical functioning (p=0.0014), and the negative
impact of cancer was associated with poorer physical functioning
(p&lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, marital status, the
belief in emotional distress as a cause of cancer, and high stress
levels, the negative impact of cancer was associated with poorer
mental functioning (p&lt;0.0001). Higher perceived positive impact
of cancer was not associated with mental functioning.
Conclusion: Long-term survivors of breast cancer in
Austria perceive both positive and negative impacts of breast
cancer. These perceptions, in particular the negative impact of
cancer, appear to influence, or are potentially influenced by,
physical and mental health-related quality of life.","Table of Contents -- I. Background 3 -- II. Methods 8 -- III.

These brief,
metaphoric narratives are windows through which we may glimpse the
Kingdom of God. The power of the parable lies in the ambiguity of
the language, rather than the artificial pretext constructed by the
church over the past two millennia. Arresting and strange, parables
do not immediately lend themselves to comprehension. In the
aphoristic words of Multatuli, ""An idea which one comprehends
immediately is often not worth comprehending."" If we are to hold
the parables as something worth comprehending then we must
reconsider how we encounter them.
Jesus did not surround himself with the learned Pharisees or the
wealthy and educated; Jesus dined with sinners and preached to the
poor. Neither Jesus nor the gospel writers interpreted the parables
for their audience. If we censor the parables by interpreting them
for the church rather than with the church, we
inhibit the power of the parable to cross the lines of what society
finds acceptable. We must be willing to risk the parable, for if we
do not, the power of the parabolic language may be stifled.
This thesis considers what it means to encounter a parable
throughout the development of one's faith by examining Greek
exegesis, metaphor theory, Flannery O'Connor's use of the short
story, and education theory. Although often taught as children's
literature, the language of the parables exceeds the concrete
cognitive abilities of juvenile interpretation. The role of the
church is not the passive acceptance of biblical interpretations;
as a church we must take an active role in parabolic engagement and
interpretation as a part of the development of faith.","Abstract -- Acknowledgements -- Chapters -- 1. An Introduction to

international and domestic students. Even fewer examined value
differences. My research intended to study the variance in work
values created by students' identity. In other words, I examined
whether being an international student influences one's values
towards work and career preference. I utilized Schwartz's theory on
work values and divided them into four aspects: intrinsic,
extrinsic, social and power. Schwartz's theory is widely referenced
and is closely connected with his basic human values. Having
conducted two surveys and four supplementary interviews, my
research data refuted the popular notion that international
students' value different dramatically from those of domestic
students'. Both demographic groups rated intrinsic and power values
similarly, and showed variance on extrinsic and social values. With
the help of my interview field notes and other scholarly journals,
I was able to offer several plausible factors for these results.
Among them the admission process was crucial for that it gathered
students from similar backgrounds and with similar values together.
Meanwhile, cultural factor still plays its role in demographical
differences, but data has proved that the difference is not as
dramatic as we expected. This research is limited to the context of
Emory University, and further study with more longitudinal data
will certainly strengthen my theories. The value of my research
lies in that it offers the educational institution with a new
perspective: international students' values are similar to domestic
students' on certain dimensions. This counterintuitive finding
provides a new direction for campus policy and fosters a new
understanding on diversity.","Table of Contents -- 1. Overview -- 1.1 International Student

PRODUCTION, 1857-1952","This dissertation argues that for more than a century and
a half, the Mexican intelligentsia approached the question of work
and its opposites in its attempts to explain the seeming
contradiction of a Mexico that was materially rich yet which
languished in underdevelopment. To this end, I trace
the constitution of what I call the Mexican ""archive of work""
through key moments in the nation's cultural history in which
attempts were made to articulate a work ethic capable of delivering
the nation into prosperity, while at the same time remaining
authentically Mexican. I define
the ""archive of work"" as a discursive matrix composed of three
conceptual nuclei--the Christian notion of duty, the liberal notion
of work as self-development, and the thermodynamic and scientistic
notion of metabolic work--which determines all discussions of work
and its opposites in modern Mexico. My chapters engage
a wide array of written cultural objects that spans a variety of
genres: from the assorted writings, legislations, articles,
speeches and novels of 19th century liberal
and conservative lettered elite, to the textual
production--philosophical treatises, essays, and novels--of the mid
twentieth century. Together, these documents allow for an
exploration of the idea of work in Mexico and the ontological and
political narratives about man's place in the world that serve as
its ground.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction 1 -- The Archive of Work 9 -- A

Patient and Physician Inputs, Outputs,
and Outcomes of the Clinical Evaluation and Management Process for
Medicare Beneficiaries with Chronic Conditions","This dissertation explores the trade-off between patient
continuity of care and physician division of labor in ambulatory
care of older adults with chronic conditions. It does so in the
context of ongoing innovation in the organization, delivery, and
payment of physician services in the United States. The physician
evaluation and management office visit is the setting in the health
care system where physicians routinely perform the core clinical
tasks of patient diagnosis, treatment, referral, and follow-up. The
challenge is performing the core clinical tasks for diverse
patients with complex care needs and shared with multiple providers
over time. The challenge is even greater for older adults with
chronic conditions who are especially reliant on regular
guideline-concordant care to maintain their functional status and
quality of life. As a result, I take the clinical evaluation and
management process and associated patient and physician inputs,
outputs, and outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes
and/or heart failure as my foci.
For a nationally representative population of Medicare
fee-for-service beneficiaries with diabetes and/or heart failure I
find that division of labor between primary care and specialist
physicians exerts a clear benefit for increasing provision of
guideline-concordant medical care and for preventing future adverse
health outcomes and hospitalization. This benefit exists in spite
of the corresponding loss in observed patient continuity of care.
In addition, I find the largest benefit for specialized physician
involvement that is the most disease-relevant.
The most important implication of this research is that it is
critical for Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions such as
diabetes and heart failure to have at least one annual evaluation
and management visit with a disease-relevant specialist, in
addition to annual involvement with a primary care physician.
Medicare policy makers should consider how to incentivize scheduled
annual involvement of disease-relevant specialists for
beneficiaries with complex chronic conditions. Lastly, to the
extent that the current trend toward physician affiliation with
multi-specialty group practices leads to more shared management of
patients with chronic conditions by primary care and specialist
physicians, the result predicted by this study is improved quality
of care and better health outcomes.","--  -- 1. Introduction and Background

Austria, 2012-2014","Breast cancer remains a threat to women's lives and
wellbeing. Globally, experiences and outcomes of breast cancer are
shaped by structural and sociocultural contexts. The globalization
of the American-style breast cancer awareness campaign has added
new dimensions to the breast cancer illness experience and to
notions of breast cancer risk and prevention. This ethnography
explores the globalization of the breast cancer awareness campaign
in Austria from 2012-2014. In spite of the worthy aims of these
campaigns, they paradoxically distract attention away from
critical shortcomings in breast cancer prevention and screening,
and do little to address long-term issues related to breast cancer.
Austria presents an interesting comparative context for exploring
this global flow, not only for the cultural tradition of keeping
cancer private, but also for the need to question the motives
behind bringing the campaign into a wealthy welfare state.
Although new in Austria, these campaigns have long been
part of the American cultural landscape. American women with
breast cancer have a complicated relationship with the campaign.
While it created the identity of the breast cancer 'survivor' and
de-stigmatized the disease, women resist the unrelenting
cheerfulness and inadequate depictions of the challenges of a
life-threatening illness. The campaign is also criticized for its
corporatization and lack of attention to disparities.
Surveys and interviews of 137 Austrian women without breast
cancer reveal misconceptions regarding breast cancer risk and
mammograms, in part due to the misuse of epidemiological data by
the breast cancer awareness campaign. Narrative interviews
with 55 women undergoing treatment for breast cancer revealed
psychosocial issues that are not addressed by the campaign. For
example, 57% (n=31) believe that emotional distress stemming from
problems in fulfilling expected gender roles caused their cancer.
The sexualized imagery of the campaign and the inability for women
with breast cancer to attend key campaign events creates a sense of
exclusivity that fails to establish solidarity.
This case study shows the spread of feminization,
sexualization, corporatization, and misuse of epidemiological data
within breast cancer awareness campaigns. This process masks key
differences between societies through its creation of a homogenous
breast cancer 'survivor.'","Table of

Mental Health Status in a Nationally Representative Sample of Young
People in Kenya","Background: Studies on food insecurity
in low-income countries primarily focus on nutritional outcomes,
leaving a gap regarding non-nutritional outcomes such as mental
health. The purpose of this study was to examine the
relationship between food insecurity and mental health outcomes in
Kenya, where a quarter of the population is food
insecure.
Methods: Using data from a nationally
representative sample of young people (ages 13-24), logistic
regression models were employed to examine the association between
food insecurity, water insecurity, and safety and mental health
outcomes including anxiety, depression, and suicidality. Estimates
were adjusted for several potential confounders including
socio-economic status.
Results: Fewer than half of study
participants lived in a household with consistent access to
food, and half reported experiencing feelings of anxiety
and/or depression at least some of the time. One in five study
participants reported fair or poor health in general. A
statistically significant relationship was observed between food
insecurity and anxiety (adjusted OR 1.37 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.75]) and
depression (aOR 1.38 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.81]) among females, but not
among males. Among males, feeling unsafe in the community was
significantly associated with depression (aOR 1.76
[95% CI: 1.13, 2.73]) and anxiety (aOR 1.98 [95% CI:
1.22, 3.21]), and predicted a 126% increased likelihood of fair or
poor perceived health. Among females, feeling unsafe in the
community was associated with depression (aOR: 1.25 [95% CI:
1.03, 1.73]) and anxiety (aOR 1.61 [95%CI (1.06, 2.42]), and
associated with a 2-fold increased likelihood of suicidality and a
130% increased likelihood of self-reported fair or poor
health.
  

Discussion: This study provides evidence to support the
hypothesis that mental health outcomes are among the
non-nutritional consequences of food insecurity. Similarly, the
high prevalence of feelings of insecurity around personal safety
among young people in Kenya has implications beyond the potential
for injury. Our results suggest that simply feeling unsafe in one's
community can have a dramatic impact on mental health as well as
perceptions of health in general.","Backgroundâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦....

Spontaneous Preterm Birth","African Americans are at increased risk for spontaneous preterm
birth (PTB), but the biological mechanisms underlying PTB are not
yet known. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, may provide
insight into the genes that are being actively regulated in those
that deliver or are delivered preterm. The objective of this study
was to evaluate DNA methylation in paired maternal blood and
umbilical cord blood (fetal) samples to identify patterns specific
to PTB. Peripheral blood from African American women who delivered
preterm (24-34 weeks) or at term (39-41weeks) was assessed for DNA
methylation across the genome using the HumanMethylation450
BeadChip. In maternal samples, no sites associated after correction
for multiple comparisons though 17,829 CpG sites associated with
PTB (p&lt;.05). Examination of paired samples, irrespective of PTB
status, identified 5,171 CpG sites in which methylation of maternal
samples predicted methylation of her respective neonate (false
discovery rate (FDR)&lt;.05). The majority of correlated CpG sites
could be attributed to one or more nearby genetic variants.
However, correlated CpG sites were significantly more likely to be
in genes involved in metabolic, cardiovascular and immune pathways,
suggesting a role for genetic and environmental contributions to
PTB risk. The observation that maternal epigenetic differences
predict fetal methylation may provide insight into the heritability
of PTB. In umbilical cord blood samples, we identified ~10,000 CpG
sites that associate with gestational age (GA), only 29 of which
associated with PTB when controlling for GA, suggesting that the
majority of CpG sites primarily reflect developmental differences
between preterm and term samples. In order to assess the
association of DNA methylation with childhood outcomes, we
investigated DNA methylation of calcitonin (CALCA), which
associated with GA in cord blood and PTB in maternal blood. DNA
methylation of CALCA did not associate with or mediate the
relationship between maternal depressive symptoms, a known risk
factor for PTB and internalizing behavioral in childhood. These
finding show the importance of DNA methylation in understanding the
risk and consequences of PTB in African Americans.","Chapter 1: Preterm Birth and Its Long-Term Effects: Methylation to

Kollwitz's A Weavers' Rebellion (1893-97)","This honors thesis examines a cycle, or series of images,
entitled A Weavers' Rebellion (Ein Weberaufstand,
1893-97) by Käthe Kollwitz, a German nineteenth- and
twentieth-century draftsman, printmaker, and sculptor. Research on
Kollwitz has been relatively limited, particularly in recent years,
and most scholars consider her work within a reductively feminist
paradigm, interpreting her art in ways that emphasize her
biography, motherhood, and womanness instead of the artistic
qualities and intricacies of her prints. In this thesis I offer a
different kind of scholarly engagement with Kollwitz and her works,
closely examining a set of her images and discussing their
significance in terms of contextually relevant theatrical and
cultural sources and theories. While recognizing the importance of
Kollwitz's identity as a woman artist, I hope to convey in this
project that the visual content of her prints and their direct
influences constitute sufficient material for analysis without
needing to invariably situate them within, or connect them to,
details of her biography.
Kollwitz based her Weavers' Rebellion cycle on a
play by Gerhart Hauptmann (1862-1946) called The Weavers
(Die Weber, 1893), which dramatizes the Silesian weavers'
rebellion of the 1840s. I use scholarly discussions of Hauptmann's
work by the playwright Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) and the literary
critic Peter Szondi (1929-1971) to analyze the ways in which
Kollwitz's cycle represents these workers. An initial consideration
of both Hauptmann's The Weavers and Kollwitz's A Weavers'
Rebellion suggests dominant readings of the works as tragic and
Naturalist, evoking feelings of empathy and pity that purge
audiences of reactive feelings and do nothing to liberate the
workers from their conditions. Further examination of both play and
cycle, however, exposes epic aspects that explicitly engage
contemporary contexts and reveal social structures responsible for
the workers' oppression. This interdisciplinary project relies on
critical theory, philosophy, and art historical methods to provide
a long warranted, in-depth analysis of Kollwitz's
images.","Introduction............... 1 -- Chapter One: Drama and Epic in

integrates various cellular pathways and interacts with active
(GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) Gα
subunits to negatively regulate G protein signaling. RGS14 is
enriched in area CA2 of the hippocampus where it acts as a natural
suppressor of long-term potentiation. The functional role of RGS14
in CA2 neurons and the mechanisms by which it limits synaptic
plasticity, however, are unknown. The subcellular localization of
proteins in their native cellular environment can provide critical
insight into their in vivo functions. All previous
information about the subcellular localization of RGS14 relied
largely on exogenous expression of recombinant protein in non-host
cells. Since mislocalization of exogenously expressed proteins is a
common problem that can give a false impression of the endogenous
protein's distribution and in vivo
functionalities, the primary aim of this study was to
investigate the subcellular localization of endogenous RGS14 in its
native cellular environment under basal conditions and following G
protein activation. Because CA2 neurons cannot be
isolated for study, we studied RGS14 localization in B35
neuroblastoma cells, the only cell line known to natively express
RGS14. Using immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging, we
found that endogenous RGS14 localizes to multiple cellular
compartments in host B35 cells and that both inactive and activated
G proteins can regulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of RGS14. Our
results suggest that RGS14 may have multiple and complex functions
in CA2 neurons, highlighting the need for future studies to
determine which of these functions is critical for RGS14-mediated
suppression of synaptic plasticity.","Table of Contents -- Background and Significance..1 --

Nutrition Examination Surveys, 2005-2012","To address limited national data exploring the factors
that contribute to depressive outcomes among individuals with
diabetes, we developed regression models to estimate the
independent associations between glycemic categories (normal
glycemia, prediabetes, diabetes) and depressive outcomes in the
United States. We used data from 21,618 adults surveyed in the
2005-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, a
nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized US
civilians. Diabetes was classified based on self-reporting a
physician diagnosis of diabetes or measured A1C ≥ 6.5%
(≥48mmol/mol). Individuals without a diagnosis of diabetes,
but whose AIC was 5.7-6.4% (39 to 47mmol/mol) were classified as
having pre-diabetes and those with AIC &lt; 5.7% (&lt;39mmol/mol)
were classified as having normal glycemic status. We used the PHQ-9
screening questionnaire to determine prevalence and odds of
‘Clinically Significant Depressive Symptoms' (CSDS) [PHQ-9
score ≥ 10 or antidepressant use] and ‘Major Depressive
Syndrome' [PHQ-9 score ≥12] (MDS). We calculated prevalence
of CSDS and MDS standardized to the 2000 US census population, and
used multivariate regression models to quantify the independent
associations between glycemic categories and both depressive
outcomes. The age standardized prevalence of CSDS in 2005-2008 was
15.2% [14.0-16.4], 15.9% [13.4-18.7], and 26.2% [21.2-31.9] for
individuals with normal glycemia, pre-diabetes, and diabetes,
respectively. For MDS, the age-standardized prevalence was 1.0%
[0.7-1.3], 1.5% [0.9-2.5], and 2.6% [1.3-4.9] for the three
glycemic groups, respectively. There were no significant changes in
either CSDS or MDS prevalence between 2005-2008 and 2009-2012 in
either crude or age-standardized estimates. While having diabetes
was associated with two-fold higher odds of depressive outcomes in
crude models, having diabetes was independently associated with a
25% greater odds of CSDS in adjusted models. The association
between diabetes and depressive symptoms suggests a need to further
integrate depression screening and treatment into routine diabetes
management.","-- Table of Contents -- Introduction. 1 -- Research

gestational diabetes mellitus among Latinas","OBJECTIVE: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of
the most common complications of pregnancy and it is more common
among minority groups (e.g., Latina women) compared to non-Hispanic
white women. GDM increases the risk of multiple fetal and maternal
perinatal outcomes, and increases a woman's subsequent risk of type
2 diabetes by over seven-fold. Studies of lifestyle interventions
to prevent GDM and its related perinatal outcomes have
conflicting results, and few studies have included Latinas. This
review and meta-analysis aimed to identify what is
currently known about the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions
and exposures for prevention and management of GDM among
Latinas.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was
performed by searching PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science,
EMBASE, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for studies
published in English or Spanish using key words relating to three
elements: 1) GDM, 2) lifestyle exposures/interventions (primarily
diet and exercise), and 3) the population of Latinas living in the
Americas. Observational and experimental studies that addressed all
three elements and provided data on the outcomes of interest were
considered eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis was carried out
using a fixed effects model to provide summary odds ratios and the
I2 assessment of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: The search returned 1647 relevant articles, from which
6 original studies were included in this review. There were no
statistically significant relationships between Latinas' reported
levels of physical activity in pre-, early, or mid-pregnancy and
the risk of developing GDM. Due to heterogeneity of study designs
and outcomes, meta-analysis was only performed for the relationship
between physical activity levels and the risk of GDM.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review identified a
dearth of studies of lifestyle interventions for prevention and
management of GDM that include Latina populations. Although this
meta-analysis found no significant association between reported
levels of physical activity and risk of GDM, it was limited to two
observational studies of physical activity amongst pregnant
Latinas, and more research is needed on this topic.","Chapter 1: Introduction -- 1.1

and Renal Function","Objective: Decreased number and function of circulating
endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been reported in patients
with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is little
information about the associations between circulating EPC levels
and renal function as measured by Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
in patients with some type of coronary heart disease
(CHD).Wepropose to obtain a summary measure of multiple circulating
EPC types based on principal component analysis, and to investigate
the associations between EPCs and GFR after adjusting for
conventional risk factors.
Methods and Results: A total of 2,145 adult patients were
enrolled prior to undergoing elective or emergent cardiac
catheterization. Measurement of EPC counts by flow cytometry was
based on the single or combination expression of surface markers on
CD45med and CD34 cells. Kidney function was measured by
GFR using the Cockcroft-Gault formula that adjusts for body weight
and body mass index. The associations between circulating EPCs and
GFR were studied using principal component scores in multiple
linear regression analyses. Statistically significant associations
between GFR and circulating EPCs were observed in both unadjusted
and adjusted analyses, indicating improvement in the number of EPCs
especially those with certain VEGF cell types contribute to an
increase in GFR levels.
Conclusions: Age, race, hypertension and diabetes are
significant risk factors for CKD. EPCs are shown to be
significantly associated with the GFR levels in the patients with
CKD after adjusting for conventional risk factors. EPCs might be
considered to be a potential therapeutic target for CKD, although
more investigations still need to be implemented.","-- 1.

Interpreter of Trauma Within African American Female Stories","ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT
What ails you?
Implicit within the core axiom of the
dissertation lies the deepened question of what ails you?
The answer drawn from a trajectory of historical accounts of the
Holy Spirit conflated against trauma as both systemic and
individual acts, characterizes the ways in which the human soul,
regardless of race, ethnicity, time or circumstance, perceive
egregious acts of violence at the intersection of the holy. From a
brief perusal of the Holy Spirit within the human experience, I
argue the human soul disconcerted by the chaotic and unbalanced
impulse of trauma responds similarly to the presence of God in the
midst of trouble. Thus, the whole note is not based solely on the
assault that has occurred or its residual effect of injustice
though I categorically referenced these as causes to work towards
eradicating forces which may seek to perpetuate evil and suffering
upon innocent souls, the focus is rather on the ephemeral power of
God to restore and to heal. In this regard, I challenge both
physiological and psychological methods as sole proprietary agents
of trauma treatment to seriously consider the evidence of God/The
Holy Spirit as a crucial; irreducible source of recovery. Moreover,
I believe by instituting the holy in the human narrative, a more
viable means for broadening the scope of trauma care may occur.
Further, I advance the etiological life group of African Americans
whose healing scripts about trauma and injustice lends itself more
toward the embedded narrative within contemporary stories that
count wisdom despite injustice as inscrutable teaching models on
how to withstand suffering in the confluence of peace. Herein, I
advance critical analysis of the African American slave narrative
alongside current traumatic recordings to be potent reiterations of
what constitutes authentic healing in modern-day America's
increasingly pluralistic populace . The study, characterized as
hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, is based on a
qualitative-inductive model experientially designed to detect
movement of the Holy Spirit while drawing an aesthetic link between
slave narratives and the way trauma is recounted in the human
experience. The study began fall, 2011 through May 2014.","CONTENTS --

Hypertensive and Diabetic Complications During Pregnancy: A
Six-year Retrospective Cohort Study in Metro Atlanta, USA","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of advanced
maternal age on adverse hypertensive and diabetic complications of
pregnancy, in relation to other major risk factors.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using Kaiser
Permanente Georgia electronic health data of pregnant women
receiving prenatal care in 12 Kaiser-affiliated Obstetrics and
Gynaecology facilities between January 1, 2005 and August 31, 2011,
with linked Georgia Birth Certificate data. Women were divided into
two age groups: 1) reference group who were 35-39 years old, and 2)
advanced maternal age (AMA) group who were 40 years and older.
Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) were calculated after adjusting for
correlation among women with multiple pregnancies, and relevant
confounders (maternal race, obesity, infertility, gravidity,
maternal education, marital status, and pre-existing medical
conditions) using log-Binomial or log-Poisson regression
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1181 pregnancies of 1096 women (939
women in reference group, 157 in AMA group) were included in the
study. Risk of chronic hypertension was significantly higher in the
AMA group (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 2.05; 95%CI, 1.48-2.86), but
risk of transient hypertension (aRR, 1.07; 95%CI, 0.51-2.22), mild
preeclampsia (aRR 1.31; 95%CI, 0.61-2.81), severe
preeclampsia/eclampsia (aRR 0.87; 95%CI, 0.26-2.86), chronic
diabetes (aRR 0.74; 95%CI, 0.37-1.50), and gestational diabetes
(aRR 0.97; 95%CI, 0.59-1.59) were not significantly increased in
the AMA group. When risk of having any hypertensive complications
was evaluated separately for white and black maternal race, AMA
remained a significant risk factor among blacks (p=0.002), but note
whites (p=0.15). Although risk of having preeclampsia or eclampsia
was more fully explained by history of chronic hypertension and
marital status than AMA, no significant risk factor was identified
for transient hypertension. Obesity, primigravida, and Asian
maternal race were identified as more significant risk factors for
gestational diabetes compared to AMA.
CONCLUSION: Advanced maternal age is an important risk
factor for chronic hypertension, but other risk factors such as
obesity, maternal race, gravidity, and pre-existing medical
conditions may play a larger role in the development of
preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Strength of
association of these risk factors may vary depending on maternal
race.","Chapter 1. Literature

The
association between urinary phytoestrogen levels and
prostate-specific antigen levels in men aged 40 and over in the US
population
by
Philip Aka Jr.
Primary Objective: To determine if
there is an association or correlation between phytoestrogenic
levels in men aged 40 and older and their PSA levels.
Secondary Objective: To confirm the
findings of previous studies that suggest a positive association
between phytoestrogens and PSA levels in men.
Research Design and Methods: The
sample analyzed is available in the 2009-2010 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset and includes 676 male
subjects age 40 and over after excluding those with missing data
for phytoestrogens. Serum PSA concentration was considered the
dependent and urinary phytoestrogen levels were consider
independent variables. Six phytoestrogens were analyzed. These
included daidzein, equol, genistein, enterodiol, enterolactone, and
O-Desmethylangolensin (O-DMA). Possible confounders included
race/ethnicity, smoking status, age, educational level,
poverty-income ratio (PIR), HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol, and
triglycerides. These variables were confounders because each has
been correlated and/or associated with increased prostate cancer
risk and can possibly be associated with phytoestrogen
levels.
Results: No statistically significant
associations between phytoestrogen levels and PSA were
found.
Conclusions: In a small sample of the
US adult male population aged 40 and over, it appears that
phytoestrogenic levels have no association with PSA
levels.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

first-episode psychosis (FEP) samples, and an emerging body of
research suggests individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for
psychosis exhibit deficits intermediate to those found in healthy
control (HC) and FEP groups. However, given the limited body of
literature to date, it is unclear how SC deficits are linked with
illness progression. This current investigation examines multiple
SC domains (i.e., emotional processing/recognition, theory of mind,
and relationship/social perception) in a sample large enough to
compare SC performance between HC and CHR groups, examine the
influence of sex on SC performance in the CHR group, and determine
the relatedness of SC performance to clinical symptoms and
functional status in CHR subjects at both baseline and 12-month
follow-up. Results indicated SC deficits in the CHR group relative
to the HC group. The influence of sex on SC performance was mixed
depending on the SC domain measured. Similarly, at baseline,
support for the relatedness of SC deficits and clinical
symptoms/functioning varied as a function of the measure. Finally,
there was no support for the predictive utility of baseline SC
deficits for clinical symptoms and functioning at 12-month
follow-up. Overall, this study contributes to efforts purposed to
gain a more thorough understanding of the role of SC impairment in
the psychosis-spectrum of disorders. Although prior investigations
suggest the predictive utility of SC for detecting those at CHR for
psychosis conversion, results from this study indicate that SC is
likely best understood as a clinical outcome domain that prompts
help-seeking behaviors in individuals who present at CHR
clinics.","--  --  --

HIV/AIDS Complacency in a National Sample of U.S. Adults","Serial nationally representative surveys describe increases in
HIV/AIDS complacency as a multi-level occurrence reflecting
HIV/AIDS as an issue of diminishing personal concern or national
importance. This phenomenon describes the public agenda on HIV,
which is influenced by media and factors such topic salience within
a community. Domestic and international studies suggest a
relationship between engaging in risky behaviors and complacency
due to HAART-related treatment optimism, as well as a relationship
between stigmatizing or homophobic beliefs with HIV/AIDS
complacency. Plausible causal models developed with MSM suggest
complacency can be operationalized as perceived threat of HIV,
predicted by perceptions of severity and susceptibility to the
disease. Participants were recruited from a nationally
representative online research panel (n=6713). A 10-point item
assessed HIV/AIDS complacency operationalized as perceived threat;
higher scores indicating HIV/AIDS as an important national issue.
One-Way ANOVA and correlations examined bivariate relationships
between complacency and the following variables: age; education;
gender; region; sexual identity; race; treatment optimism; stigma;
homophobia. Participants' mean perceived threat score was 6.5
(SD=2.1). Blacks (M=7.9, SD=2.0) and Hispanics (M=6.7, SD=2.2)
scored higher than whites (M=6.2, SD=2.0). Bivariate analyses
indicated that statistically significant differences in mean
perceived threat score existed among all measures. The final
multivariate model included all measures and explained 18% of the
variance in perceived threat. Decrease perceived threat was related
to treatment optimism, while increased perceived threat was related
stigmatizing beliefs about people with HIV or AIDS, and
non-homophobic beliefs. The largest predictor of perceived threat
was race, potentially because of topic salience in particular
racial/ethnic communities. As complacent individuals are more
likely to engage in risky behaviors, prevention efforts should
consider these individual and community-level differences when
engaging the public with HIV prevention messages.","INTRODUCTION 1 HIV/AIDS Complacency 2 Public Opinion 5 Media and

Cluster Size","The first part of this dissertation focuses on the development
of copula based joint modeling approaches for the clustered
survival data with a random cluster size. We propose to adopt
Clayton-Oakes model (Clayton, 1978; Oakes, 1989) for measurements
within a cluster and the cluster size is modeled via a discrete
survival model. The methods are motivated by the Mount Sinai Study
of Women Office Workers (MSSWOW) where women were prospectively
followed for one year for studying fertility. For each woman,
menstrual cycle lengths (MCLs) are recorded until time-to-pregnancy
(TTP) or the end of study.
We first consider specifying a parametric distribution as the
marginal survival distribution in the Clayton-Oakes model and TTP
is modeled using a grouped version of the usual continuous time Cox
regression model (Scheike and Jensen, 1997). Second, we consider a
semiparametric linear transformation model (Cheng et al., 1995) for
the marginal distribution of the Clayton-Oakes model. We develop an
EM algorithm to derive an approximate generalized maximum
likelihood estimator. We also provide a computationally simple
estimation procedure known as the ""two-stage"" approach. Asymptotic
theory for the ""two-stage"" estimators is established. Simulation
studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
joint model and estimation procedures. The proposed methods are
also applied to the MSSWOW data.
In the second part of this dissertation, we consider the
problem of testing whether a repeatedly measured quantitative
biomarker is associated with a subsequent time-to-event process. We
propose a nonparametric testing procedure to evaluate the null
hypothesis by adopting a linear mixed model for repeated measures,
but without imposing modeling assumptions on the time to event. The
proposed test can utilize all the information provided by the
random effects and is not sensitive to the model misspecification
of the time-to-event process. We show that the proposed test
statistic is asymptotically consistent and normally distributed
under both null and alternative hypotheses. We demonstrate the
validity of the new nonparametric test using simulation studies and
compare the proposed method to a model-based score test. We finally
apply the proposed method to a real data from epidemiological study
to illustrate its practical utility.","Contents -- Abstract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Barth","James Cone and Karl Barth have very different, but ultimately
compatible and even complementary views of the nature and mission
of the Church. A survey of the two theologians' work reveals an
emphasis in Cone's writing on the Church as a community
characterized by and participating in the suffering of Christ, and
an emphasis in Barth's writing on the Church as a community
characterized by and participating in the victory of Christ. It
would seem that these two points of view are conflicting. However,
since both theologians take as a point of departure the historical
and theological reality of the incarnation of the Word of God,
there is an intersection between their views of the Church. In the
incarnation of Jesus Christ, we see the convergence of suffering
and triumph, both the reality of death and the promise of
resurrection. Jesus Christ, in the incarnation, is God's statement
of solidarity with those who suffer, those who are oppressed. The
Kingdom of God is ultimately a kingdom of the oppressed. God with
and for God's people is the God who has shown willingness to suffer
alongside those who suffer. The Church, which is the ongoing
incarnation of Jesus Christ in the world, must suffer in order to
experience the restoration of all things to their right
relationship with God. The Church achieves the nexus of its praxis
and its kerygma when it proclaims that, while suffering is
not the last word in the life of the Church, its suffering is
necessary in order to experience ultimate triumph over the kingdom
of this world. The Church participates in Christ's final victory
because the Church shares in Christ's suffering. There is no
resurrection if there is no cross. Here the ecclesiological
viewpoints of Barth and Cone come into conversation and find common
ground with one another. This essay will examine Barth and Cone in
their particular contexts as theologians, as teachers, and as
pastors in order to articulate similarities and differences in
their ecclesiological perspectives and to discern how these
perspectives might apply to the Church today.","Introduction...................................................................................................................................

Discontinuation Compete in Observational Data","In clinical studies, randomization of treatment lengths may not
be feasible in practice, resulting in the confounding of treatment
effects. Moreover, treatment decisions may be missing due to
treatment-terminating events. Therefore, to estimate the mean
outcome across treatment lengths while accounting for the above
obstacles, we propose several new estimators using causal inference
theory and methods for different treatment assignment
settings.

In the first project, we propose a new direct estimator for the
mean outcome of a target treatment length policy using outcome
regression. The estimator works well in both discrete and
continuous time. We exemplify the direct estimator through small
sample numerical studies and the analysis of two real data sets and
show the direct estimator is more precise.

In many dynamic regimes, patients' treatment plan may vary with
changes in their clinical characteristics that measured at routine
clinic visits, which may also be confounded with patients'
outcomes. To taking into account of the time-varying effects, in
the second project, we implemented the G-computational algorithm in
outcome regression with two approaches to estimate the mean
potential outcome on treatment length policies. In simulation
studies, our approaches are more efficient compared to an existing
inverse probability weighting estimator. It could also approximate
the distribution as well as the mean of the potential
outcomes.

To maintain the consistency of our estimators proposed in the
previous two projects, the outcome regression models must be
correctly specified, which may not be always met. To achieve a
consistent estimation under moderate miss-specification, under the
same dynamic regime setting as project 2, we propose a
doubly-robust estimator and an improved doubly-robust estimators
for estimating the mean potential outcomes while adjusting for
time-varying effects. They demonstrate desirable properties for
small samples in simulation studies and the improved doubly robust
estimator achieves minimum variance even when the outcome
regression model may be miss-specified.","--  -- Contents -- 1 Introduction 1 -- 1.1 Introduction .

TREATING PTSD IN FEMALE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ABUSE THROUGH FEMINIST PASTORAL
COUNSELING: A CASE STUDY
by Jennifer Winingder
The central underlying question to be explored in this Dissertation
is as follows: are current approaches to working
with female survivors of childhood sexual abuse adequate and
effective? The goals of this case
study will be an examination of psychotherapeutic theories of
female development, socio-cultural elements that influence a
woman's self-identity in modern American society, and pastoral,
liberative and narrative therapeutic practices that can help a
trauma survivor address past abuse and move towards healing in a
healthy, holistic, and empowered
manner. In order to understand the
effect of childhood sexual abuse on female development and
identity, exploration of the effects of trauma on the brain and
body was undertaken, and observations were made about the
differences between sexual assault and sexual abuse. Comparisons
between various forms of therapeutic and spiritual practices
currently utilized in mental health and pastoral counseling were
made in order to reach helpful conclusions about the particular
needs of survivors of sexual abuse in therapy. Through the
exploration of available literature on treating PTSD in survivors
of childhood sexual abuse, it has become clear that there is a lack
of significant resources on working with this particular population
of people living with PTSD.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CHAPTERI: INTRODUCTION 13 --

Society","This dissertation provides a systematic account of the
development of Giambattista Vico's conception of society as it is
presented primarily in his Inaugural
Orations, Universal Law,
and New Science. Three claims remain
constant between these three works: (1) Humans are essentially
social, (2) Humans do not cause society, but rather occasion it,
and (3) the task of the philosopher is to promote humanity's social
nature in the face of the otherwise destructive and anti-social
impulses brought about as a result of original sin. Many additional
features of Vico's conception of society anticipate the modern
conception of society that made the social sciences possible. As
with modern conceptions of society, Vico's is as a thing separable
both from the state and from the individuals that make it up. But
Vico's theological commitments prevent him from being interested in
society for its own sake. A defining feature of the modern concept
of society is a secularism that finds explanations for social
phenomena in society itself. Vico is unwavering in his theological
commitments. For Vico, society is not an active agent that produces
social effects, but is rather a passive aggregate of individuals
that is acted upon by a force that is outside of itself: Divine
Providence. For this reason, it is argued that Vico's conception of
society is not yet modern.","Introduction...........................................................................................1

neuropsychological disorders emerging during adolescence, such as
depression and anxiety. To advance a mechanistic understanding of
social development during this period, a primate model of
adolescence is needed and will provide a vehicle for the
application of novel therapies. I propose the rhesus macaque as a
model due to the species social complexity and protracted childhood
and adolescent period.
To measure social maturation in untrained, nonverbal animals I
measured behavioral changes to social and emotional stimuli using
infrared eye tracking and an emotional
reactivity task in three juvenile and three adult male macaques.
Juveniles were tested at 18, 22, and 26 months of age, making this
the first longitudinal examination of macaque adolescent social
development.
As measured by changes in fixation duration and frequency to the
eyes and body of unknown macaques, I report normative adult
patterns, as well as developmental changes, in nonhuman social and
emotional processing. In adults, the eyes negative social stimuli
are looked at more frequently than neutral or positive stimuli.
However, this normative pattern is not seen in the late juvenile
stage. At 18 months of age, macaques look longer at social stimuli
generally, and usually without regard to emotion. By 22 months,
this broad social attention significantly decreases within both the
body and the eyes. At 26 months, fixation duration once again
increases, and is now accompanied by more adult-like patterns of
emotional attention. In addition to changes in fixation behavior,
measures of emotional reactivity correspond with this pattern, such
that 18 month olds are reactive to novel stimuli irrespective of
valence, but by 22 and 26 months of age they show an adult-like
pattern of increased reactivity only toward novel negative stimuli.
Taken together, these data document continuing pre-pubertal changes
in social and emotional attention toward an adult-like pattern in a
nonhuman primate. These data lay the groundwork for future
comparative studies with human subjects that may elucidate the
ongoing development of social and emotional processing during the
adolescent period.","INTRODUCTION................................................................................................................

Dependent on 5' Ribozyme Sequence, Poly-A Tail Length, or Human
Codon Optimization","Human Norovirus is a serious health problem that is
understudied due to a lack of tractable rescue systems for
understanding virus biology. Since its discovery nearly half a
century ago, Norovirus has proven a difficult virus to study
because pure virus alone does not replicate in any known cell
culture system, there is no physiological small animal model, and
there exists only inefficient rescue systems for the virus. The
lack of a model system in which to study the virus has lead to a
paucity of understanding of even basic features of the virus life
cycle, general biology, and pathogenesis in humans. The goal of
this research endeavor was to adapt the published rescue systems
for Norovirus to the clinically relevant GII.4 New Orleans
genotype, to increase precision of viral transcripts through the
use of ribozymes, and to increase protein expression through human
codon optimization, all with the aim of increasing the likelihood
of successful recovery of infectious human Norovirus.
A cDNA clone encoding a full-length genome for GII.4 human
Norovirus was cloned under control of a T7 promoter sequence. This
clone featured a number of modifications upon the published rescue
systems for GII.3 Norovirus, including a 5' ribozyme sequence
between the T7 promoter and the 5' UTR of the Norovirus genome, as
well as a longer poly-A tail corresponding to the natural poly-A
tail of human Norovirus (HuNoV). In addition to this base genome,
another construct was assembled featuring GII.4 HuNoV cDNA
optimized for protein expression in human cells. This optimization
relies on a concept known as codon bias, or the genomic frequency
of certain codons for a given amino acid. All reading frames of the
HuNoV genome in this construct were modified to match human codon
bias to increase viral protein expression in an attempt to improve
viral rescue efficiency in mammalian cells.
These modifications did not result in measurable protein
expression, and neither RNA replication nor viral protein
expression was detected in cells transfected with either construct.
This thesis demonstrates that GII.4 Norovirus rescue is not
dependent on codon optimization, 5' ribozyme sequence, or poly-A
tail length.","Table of Contents --

Aggression and Anxiety/Depression Problems","Maternal depression is a well-established risk factor for
a range of negative developmental outcomes in offspring, including
internalizing and externalizing problems. However, the role of
maternal depression in the development of co-occurring
internalizing and externalizing problems is not well understood.
Given the chronicity and severity of co-occurring child behavior
problems, it is important to understand the contributing risk
factors and mechanisms for these outcomes. Using a group-based
trajectory modeling technique, the current study identified
developmental trajectory groups that exhibited chronic co-occurring
aggression and anxiety/depression problems, only chronic aggression
problems, and only chronic anxiety/depression problems. Exposure to
perinatal maternal depression (both prenatal and postnatal) was
examined in relation to these distinct behavioral problem groups.
Mediation and moderation paths were also tested to understand the
mechanisms through which maternal depression may have its impact
and to identify subgroups that might be at higher risk. Results
revealed differential patterns in the risk and mechanisms of risk
transmission from prenatal/postnatal depression to chronic
co-occurring, chronic aggression, and chronic anxiety/depression
problems. In particular, our results revealed direct associations
between prenatal and postnatal maternal depression and co-occurring
problems, and prenatal maternal depression and chronic aggression.
In addition, we found support for the mediating roles of stressful
family environments and negative maternal parenting. Implications
of these findings on psychopathology research and
prevention/intervention strategies were discussed.","Table of Contents --

models/methods together with the improvements in the data
acquisition devices have made possible to use mathematics to study
the behavior of the human cardiovascular system. Furthermore,
cardiovascular mathematics has not been limited to be used as a
descriptive qualitative tool, but instead, has started to be used
for quantitative analysis of patients conditions and even treatment
design. The robustness of this tool depends on the reliability of
the results. Data Assimilation (DA) is a set of techniques that
helps to improve the specificity of the model, by incorporating
available data into the model and therefore leading to patient
specific results. On the other hand, the numerical methods used in
the simulations must be accurate enough to guarantee that the
computed solution accurately describes the real behavior of the
system.
This work is divided into two parts. In the first, we focus on
the estimation of the compliance of a blood vessel using DA
techniques. In particular, we use measurements of the displacement
of the vessel wall to estimate its Young's modulus. We adopt the
variational approach proposed Perego et al. (2011), and we focus on
the issue of the computational costs associated with the solution
of the inverse problem. The secon part concerns the accurate
simulation of flows at moderately large Reynolds numbers. In
particular, we focus on the model proposed in Layton et al. (2012)
for the discretization of the Leray system, and we propose a new
interpretation of the method as an operator-splitting scheme, for a
perturbed version of the Navier-Stokes equations, and we use
heuristic arguments to calibrate one of the main parameters of the
model.
For both these parts we will perform numerical experiments, on
3D geometries, to validate the approaches. In particular, for the
first part, we will use synthetic measures to validate our
approach, while for the second part, we will test the method on a
benchmark proposed by the Food and Drug Administration, comparing
out results with experimental data.","1 Introduction -- 1.1 Cardiovascular mathematics -- 1.2 Some of the

individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis","Extant literature suggests that individuals with serious mental
illness are at increased risk for overweight and obesity (Robson
&amp; Gray, 2007), and the introduction of pharmacological
interventions, particularly atypical antipsychotics, puts this
population at greater risk for increased adiposity and metabolic
issues (Green et al., 2000). Research also indicates that those who
suffer from severe mental illness experience greater stress
(Trotman et al., 2014). Given that stress is also related to
overweight and obesity (Adam &amp; Epel, 2007), exploration of the
relationship between atypical antipsychotic medication, stress, and
weight is warranted. This study was a cross-sectional investigation
of atypical antipsychotic use and stress in predicting weight in a
sample of youth at clinical high risk for developing psychosis.
Participant data was obtained as a part of the North American
Prodrome Longitudinal Study Phase 2 (NAPLS-2). Self-reported
weight, atypical antipsychotic use, daily stress (hassles) in the
past 24 hours, and life events stress within the last year were
assessed in clinical high-risk participants who were on and off
atypical antipsychotics at an initial assessment as a part of the
longitudinal study. Individuals taking atypical antipsychotic
medications weighed more than those not taking these medications,
and several measures of stressful events (dependent life events,
desirable life events, and undesirable life events stress) were
correlated with weight. Gender did not moderate the effect of
atypical antipsychotic use on weight but dependent events and
desirable life events stress moderated the relationship between
atypical antipsychotic use and weight. Post hoc analyses revealed
that there was a significant relationship between atypical
antipsychotic use and negative and general symptoms. Findings
suggest that a better understanding of the contribution of stress
to weight gain in this population may be worthwhile to consider in
developing interventions to address psychosocial factors that may
exacerbate or buffer the effects of antipsychotic medication on
weight gain.","-- TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction 1-5 -- Atypical Antipsychotic

Mouse Model","Huntington's Disease (HD) is an incurable autosomal dominant,
debilitating
neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat
expansion in exon 1 of
the huntingtin (Htt) gene, which encodes a polyglutmine (polyQ)
repeat tract in the Nterminal
Htt. The disease is characterized by neurological symptoms such as
chorea,
dystonia, bradykinesia, dementia, and normally affects the
mid-elderly. In severe cases,
HD can onset at a much younger age because of large polyQ repeat
expansions that are
often in excess of 55 glutamines. Pathologically, HD is hallmarked
by the formation of
mutant Htt (mHtt) aggregate accumulation in the brain and
neurodegeneration that
preferentially affects the striatum. HD affects roughly 30,000
patients in the US, mostly
of Western-European descent. Although there are efforts to treat HD
by stemming and
ameliorating its symptoms, so far, no treatments have been
successful at preventing or
delaying the development of this devastating disease. Berberine
(BBR) is an
abundantly-available, botanically-derived organic small molecule
that is traditionally
used orally to treat bacterial diarrhea and is well-tolerated in
humans both in chronic
and high-dosage use. Recently, BBR has shown protective effects on
neurodegenerative
conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease,
which sparked our
interest in the possible effects of BBR against HD. In this study,
we show that BBR
treatment reduces mHtt aggregation both in a transfected cell model
and in the brains
of a transgenic HD mouse model via up-regulation of autophagic
clearance of mutant
proteins. The HD mice exhibited drastically improved motor function
and a slightly
increased lifespan. These encouraging results on HD mouse models
also provide
mechanistic insight into the broad effects of BBR on
neurodegenerative diseases caused
by misfolded aggregated proteins.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Chapter 1: Introduction 1 -- 1.1 Huntington's

Social Adversity and Behavioral and Health Outcomes","Exposure to environmental stress can increase an
individual's risk for behavioral problems, psychopathology, and
chronic health conditions. Importantly individuals with different
genetic profiles vary in their responsiveness to these
environments, and thus their likelihood of developing adverse
outcomes. Given the social nature of many stressful environments,
genetic factors related to the oxytonergic system may be relevant
to environmental differential susceptibility. Oxytocin is a hormone
important for perceiving social cues. Therefore, the oxytonergic
system may influence perception of, and thus sensitivity towards,
both nurturing and adverse social environments. While much of the
initial human oxytocin work draws from positive social
environments, more recent work has incorporated adverse social
contexts. This dissertation expands this literature, exploring
genetic differences in the oxytocin receptor gene (sequence
variation and methylation patterns) in the association between
adverse social environments and behavioral and health outcomes,
including responsiveness to intervention.
First, in a prospective cohort of youth (N=404), we tested
the role of OXTR genetics in the association between
interpersonal conflict and conduct and antisocial behaviors at age
15 and 20, finding that individuals with the rs53576 GG genotype
engaged in more disordered behavior when exposed to high levels of
interpersonal conflict. Second, in a sample of adults (N=393), we
assessed the role of OXTR DNA methylation in the association
between abuse and psychopathology, finding that individuals with
specific OXTR CpG methylation patterns reported higher
levels of depression and anxiety when exposed to abuse, compared to
those without those patterns. OXTR sequence variation and
methylation were also considered together, with OXTR
genotypes associating with methylation of nearby CpG sites. Third,
in a sample of parent-youth pairs (N=191), we explored the role of
OXTR genetics on responsiveness to a family-based
intervention. Youth with the rs53576 GG genotype again showed the
greatest sensitivity to environmental context, exhibiting the
shortest telomeres when exposed to high parent-youth conflict and
randomized to the control intervention condition, and telomere
lengths similar to the non at-risk group when randomized to the
intervention.
The combined findings suggest a role for OXTR in
sensitivity to the social environment and in the prediction of
behavioral and health outcomes.","-- CHAPTER 1: Introductory Literature Review --

sexual risk taking among adult black women.","HIV/AIDS rates continue to be substantially higher among
Blacks than among Hispanics or Whites. Additionally, women are at a
higher risk of HIV infection than are men. Black women carry a
""double jeopardy"" when it comes to HIV as they are at increased
risk because of both race and gender. Gender-based power,
relationship dynamics, and relationship context are important
social factors in women's sexual health choices and safer sex
negotiations and, yet, there is a lack of understanding of power
dynamics among midlife and older adults and the impact these
relationships have on women, especially black women. A
mixed-methods study was undertaken to examine the association of
age with sexual health, including psychosocial risk factors,
relationship characteristics, relationship-specific behaviors, and
personal and relationship power dynamics among black women, to
inform interventions that can be targeted for black women across
adulthood, but more specifically, for black women entering middle
age (35-55 years old) and later life. Main themes from this
dissertation include midlife black women's relationship empowerment
built through personal power and life experiences, women's high
sexual self-efficacy for sexual communication and condom use, and
women's reported low condom use with main or primary
partners.
Findings emphasize the need to explore characteristics
(such as concurrency, peer norms, future orientation, and
self-efficacy) among midlife women that have been mostly
investigated among younger (adolescent and young adult) populations
to better understand and intervene on beliefs and behaviors that
are putting midlife women at an increased risk for HIV and STIs.
Additionally, findings serve to inform efforts to increase personal
and relationship power as well as self-efficacy through programs
and intervention research for preventive behaviors in an attempt to
reduce the rates of new HIV and STI infections among midlife black
women.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1. Literature

Discourse, and Moral Transformation","Some who survive mass violence feel they have done so only by
committing acts previously thought to be immoral. This can leave a
lasting change in one's moral subjectivity, so much so that
survivors often wonder if they can ever be ""good"" again. This is an
issue for many who pass through violence feeling that they are no
longer able to live in society, or even that society or the world
can no longer be seen as a place where goodness is possible,
however goodness is defined. Political violence can undermine the
moral intelligibility of one's world, leaving a residue of doubt
and even despair about the possibility of a restored moral ability
and a world capable of supporting a meaningful moral life.

This work focuses on ways that we can better understand experiences
where political violence and upheaval transform the self as well as
society. New vocabularies are needed to articulate what matters
most for those caught in contemporary violent conflicts, as current
frames do not capture the high moral stakes involved for
individuals. Specifically, we need to draw on the moral languages
and philosophical anthropologies found in religious ethics and
moral philosophy if we are to do justice to these experiences and
the high stakes that are involved. I argue that the language of the
virtues, in particular, can help us create a thick representation
of the self not just as a subject in the world but primarily as a
moral subject for whom experience is best understood as moral
development through continuous transformation of one's moral
subjectivity. Such a resource is not currently available in most
discussions of political violence. Virtue discourse, as I will
refer to it, will provide the vocabulary and understanding of the
self needed to account for and articulate the experience of
political violence. Using Iris Murdoch's moral philosophy, and
specifically her representation of moral subjectivity as a ""field
of tension"" and a search for the ""Good,"" I create a critical,
interpretive framework to better articulate and account for the
felt sense of having lost moral ability through the experience of
political violence.","Chapter One: Violence, Self, and Virtue 1 -- Violence and

Preschool Years","Background: A great deal of animal research as well as available
human research suggests that psychological distress experienced by
the mother during gestation is associated with later
neurodevelopmental deficits in offspring. However, most research
investigating the outcomes associated with prenatal stress in
humans has been conducted during infancy, leaving many questions
unanswered regarding the long term effects of prenatal distress on
child neurocognitive development. The current study examined the
impact of maternal distress during pregnancy on neurocognitive
outcomes in preschool age children, as well as potential mediators
and moderators of this risk pathway. Specifically, children's
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning (i.e., cortisol
reactivity) was examined as a mediator and parenting behaviors were
examined as moderators. Methods: Mother-child dyads (N=162)
were recruited from a longitudinal cohort of women who had
previously participated in a study on maternal mood during
pregnancy. Maternal distress during pregnancy was constructed as a
latent variable, based on a combination of self-report and
clinician rated measures collected throughout the course of
pregnancy. During a follow-up visit, information was collected
regarding mother's symptomatology since the child's birth and
children's neurocognitive abilities. In addition, cortisol
reactivity was assessed via saliva samples before and after a
stressor task, and parenting behaviors were recorded during a
parent-child interaction. Results: Maternal prenatal distress
significantly predicted to children's lower general cognitive and
expressive language abilities. This relationship was moderated by
parent positive engagement such that the relationship was strongest
for children whose mothers exhibited low levels of positive
engagement and was not significant for mothers who exhibited high
levels of positive engagement. Children's cortisol reactivity was
not found to be a mediator. Conclusions: Prenatal maternal
distress, measured in a multi-informant, comprehensive manner
predicts to lower cognitive functioning in preschool aged children,
particularly when mothers display low levels of positive parenting.
The findings are discussed with regard to clinical implications and
future research directions.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction

Aggression, Facial Emotion Recognition, and Polymorphisms in the
Monoamine Oxidase A and Serotonin Transporter Genes","Research has demonstrated that individuals high in antisocial
traits tend to have difficulty recognizing fearful and sad facial
expressions, though researchers have not attempted to link these
deficits to specific forms of aggression, such as reactive and
proactive aggression. Two genetic markers frequently studied in
association with aggression, a repeat sequence in the promoter
region of the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA-uVNTR) and a
polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter
gene (5-HTTLPR). These genes are active in brain regions involved
in aggression and facial emotion recognition, such as the amygdala
and regulatory prefrontal regions, suggesting that facial emotion
recognition deficits or biases may serve as endophenotypes for
aggression. In a sample of 180 twins genotyped for the MAOA-uVNTR
and 5-HTTLPR, we found that the MAOA-uVNTR low-activity allele was
associated with a lower proportion of correct fear recognitions,
more fear commission errors, and more sad commission errors on a
facial emotion recognition task, while the 5-HTTLPR short allele
was associated with a higher proportion of correct sad recognitions
and more sad commissions. We also found that fewer correct fear
recognitions, more fear commissions, and the MAOA-uVNTR risk allele
were associated with reactive aggression, while more fear
commissions was also associated with proactive aggression. In
addition, we found that the proportion of correct fear
recognitions, and fear and sad commissions separately mediated the
relation between the MAOA-uVNTR and reactive aggression. These
results suggest that impaired fear recognition is related to both
reactive and proactive aggression. Further, the influence of
MAOA-uVNTR on reactive aggression seems to act in part through
impaired fear recognition, indicating that facial emotion
recognition may be a useful endophenotype for reactive
aggression.","Table of Contents -- General Introduction 1 -- Current Study 9 --

Analysis of Mandatory disclosures, Voluntary disclosures, and
Information Intermediaries","This paper examines the dynamics of a firm's information
environment and how the components of the firm's information
environment affect equity valuation of the firm. I examine the
dynamics of a firm's information environment by investigating the
relations among mandatory disclosures
(ManDisc), voluntary disclosures
(VolDisc), and information generated by
information intermediaries (InfoInt). I find
that firms with superior ManDisc also have
superior VolDisc and superior
InfoInt. The positive correlations between the three
information channels suggest they are complementary in
communicating to investors. I then examine the impact of the three
information channels on equity valuation. Specifically, I examine
the impact of each information channel on the stock price deviation
from the firm's fundamental value, as calculated by the residual
income valuation model. In the unconditional tests, I find that all
three information channels affect equity valuation. However, in the
conditional tests, I find that the disclosure effect of
ManDisc on equity valuation disappears when I control
for VolDisc and InfoInt.
This evidence cautions against drawing inferences exclusively from
the evidence of relations between equity valuation and one
information channel. All three information channels contribute to a
firm's overall information environment.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CONTENT PAGE -- 1. Introduction
