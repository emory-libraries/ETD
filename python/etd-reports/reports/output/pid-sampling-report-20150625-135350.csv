Microcredit Groups on Empowerment in Eastern Kenya","Background: Over 40% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population
lives on less than $1 a day,
and the region is at risk of not meeting any of the Millennium
Development Goal targets.1
For the past 40 years, microfinance has been heralded as a solution
to poverty, a means of
empowerment, and a way to directly improve health outcomes.
However, there is little
published research that has examined the effect of microfinance on
empowerment in an
African context.
Objectives: This research will examine how women's
involvement in Vinya Wa Aka, a
unique microcredit group in Eastern Kenya, influences empowerment
as a process and
outcome. This research seeks to address the gap in literature on
empowerment and
microcredit in Kenya.
Methods: This study uses a case study approach with two
groups of participants, VWA
founders and trainees. A total of 24 in-depth interviews were
conducted in 5 study sites in
Nairobi and Eastern Province, Kenya. Participants were selected
based on differential
length of involvement, residence, and income-generating activities.
Grounded theory
guided data collection and analysis, with comparison and
conceptualization being used
extensively. Participant observations were also conducted during
social and business
meetings with VWA founders.
Results: Money plays a complex role in the groups'
empowerment, yet it was reported as
one of the least important benefits of involvement with VWA. There
was a clear, cyclical
process of ""enlightenment"" and empowerment that occurred in the
trainee groups due to
their involvement with VWA. ""Enlightenment"" consisted of trainings,
where participants
were ""exposed"" to new ideas and ""woken up"" to the possibilities
that this unique model
could provide. Participants were empowered through ""moving up""
financially and
socially, achieving security in the group, and finally, feeling
stable enough to ""move
forward"" and help other groups achieve empowerment, thus continuing
the cycle.
Discussion: In public health discourse, ""empowerment"" is
often proxy for development,
increasing women's status, and improving women's health outcomes.
This research
provides the process by which women in this microcredit group begin
to achieve such
empowerment, which de-emphasizes monetary inputs, and which may
prove useful to
donors and others engaged in public health work in Kenya.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --
