Paul on the Road to Natchez: Conversion and Resurrection in the
Christ-Haunted South
By Mary Elizabeth Button
Paul on the Road to Natchez is a project that is comprised
of both paintings and essays in
which the conversion of Paul is imagined at various sites along the
Natchez Trace. In
each of the fifteen pieces in the series, well-know images of
Saul's conversion (some
from art history, others from family Bibles) have been reproduced
within an illustration
of sites along the Natchez Trace. Saul's journey to Damascus, and
the blinding light of
the resurrected Christ that transforms Saul into Paul, provides the
narrative structure for
the project.

Islands of Memory: The Sea Islands, Black Women Artists, and the
Promise of Home
By Folashadé Alao

This study examines the development and construction of the Sea
Islands as a
significant cultural landscape in the black imagination and
historicizes the processes
informing the Sea Islands' contemporary emergence as a site of
memory. The
coalescence of cultural and academic interests, the publication of
new research materials
on the Sea Islands, and the discovery and republication of old
works, such as Drums and
Shadows, during the 1970's enabled the Sea Islands to emerge in
the national black
imagination in new ways that black visual artists and writers would
illuminate. The
movement of Gullah culture into the mainstream and the elevation of
the Sea Islands as a
site of memory were aided particularly by literary, dramatic,
musical, and visual arts and
the sustained interests and creative expressions of different
groups of artists.
This study focuses on the particular visualizations of the Sea
Islands in Paule
Marshall's Praisesong for the Widow (1983), Gloria Naylor's
Mama Day (1988), and
Julie Dash's film Daughters of the Dust (1991) and novel
Daughters of the Dust (1997).
Specifically, I underscore the sources they draw upon to construct
their visions; the
voices, images, and histories they challenge; the functions they
hope such a vision will
hold for their readers; and their works' place within the Sea
Islands Cultural Renaissance
which surrounds their publication. Marshall, Naylor, and Dash's
works capture and
respond to a transforming relationship between African Americans
and their African
ancestry as well as to the southern landscape, both of which
resulted from the social and
political struggles of the 1960s and 1970s and a shift in black
migratory patterns in the
1970s. Marshall, Naylor, and Dash's works also reflect a renewed
critical study of
African American origins and genealogy, and the increasing concerns
surrounding the
transformations of black urban and rural life. The Sea Islands, in
these works, emerge as
a site of intersections, continuity, and reconnections with
southern homeplaces, distant
African memories, submerged oral histories, and neglected cultural
traditions.","Table of Contents -- Introduction -- 5 -- Chapter 1 -- ""A Sacred

streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model with bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem cells","Recent evidence has suggested that diabetic neuropathy
(DN) is pathophysiologically related to both impaired angiogenesis
and a deficiency of neurotrophic factors in the nerves. It is
widely known that vascular and neural growth are intimately
associated. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote angiogenesis in
ischemic diseases and have neuroprotective effects, particularly on
Schwann cells. Accordingly, we investigated whether DN could be
improved by local transplantation of MSCs by augmenting
angiogenesis and neural regeneration such as remyelination. In
sciatic nerves of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, motor
and sensory nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) and capillary
density were reduced, and axonal atrophy and demyelination were
observed. After injection of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs)
into hindlimb muscles, NCVs were restored to near-normal levels.
Histological examination demonstrated that injected MSCs were
preferentially and durably engrafted in the sciatic nerves, and a
portion of the engrafted MSCs were distinctively localized close to
vasa nervora of sciatic nerves. Furthermore, vasa nervora increased
in density, and ultrastructure of myelinated fibers in nerves were
observed to be restored. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed that
gene expression of multiple factors involved in angiogenesis,
neural function, and myelination were increased in the MSC-injected
nerves. These findings suggest that MSC transplantation improved DN
through direct peripheral nerve angiogenesis, neurotrophic effects,
and restoration of myelination.","Table of Contents --

Flow Cytometry Analysis Pipeline","Flow cytometry (FCM) is a popular technique, in basic and
clinical research, for the high-throughput characterization of
cellular properties. Modern FCM instruments are now capable of
measuring up to 20 characteristics of an individual cell, resulting
in a rich array of multidimensional information on hundreds of
thousands of cells. Data analysis, however, remains a challenging
aspect of FCM research; the ability to acquire large
multidimensional datasets has outpaced the ability to accurately
and reproducibly detect expected and novel cell populations and
efficiently test biological hypotheses.
The main objective of this work is to develop and validate a
mechanistic pipeline that addresses the challenges found in
high-throughput, multidimensional FCM data analysis. My pipeline
development employs state-of-the art biomedical informatics
software that can be integrated with clinical outcomes.
The pipeline consists of five key steps: 1) data preprocessing,
2) automated gating, 3) automated labeling, 4) feature extraction,
and 5) feature selection. A robust quality assessment step was
implemented at every step of the pipeline to account for potential
sources of systematic error prior to entering a subsequent step in
the pipeline. Validation against human expert analyses showed good
detection of expected cell populations. The integration of
state-of-the art informatics techniques into a single pipeline
shows great potential for scalability to hundreds of thousands of
events and multiple dimensions.
In particular, this pipeline can be used to assess a transplant
recipient's immune repertoire over time in single patients and in a
cross-sectional patient population with diverse diagnostic and
demographic characteristics. The main assumption in the proposed
pipeline is that the mechanisms driving complications in organ
transplantation intersect in a way that is both anticipatable and
measurable.","Chapter 1 -- Introduction 1 -- 1.1 FCM Technology and Data Analysis

Prosecuting War Criminals in Bosnia and Herzegovina
This study empirically evaluates the relationship between
post-conflict justice and
reconciliation by assessing the impact of war crimes trials on
processes of local reconciliation
across sub-national units in post-conflict Bosnia. The study finds
that post-conflict justice
positively impacts reconciliation in municipalities that
experienced the most severe violence of
the war, while providing no significant impact in municipalities
that experienced less violence
and potentially an adverse impact in municipalities that
experienced the absolute least amount of
wartime violence. These results suggest the need for a more complex
theory of the relationship
between reconciliation and post-conflict justice.","Table of Contents --

MEDITATION IN A SECULAR MODE","Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) is a
Buddhist-Inflected Secular Meditation (BISM) program based on
teachings from the lam rim and lojong traditions of
Tibetan Buddhism. This program is one constituent in a burgeoning
field of meditation programs pursuing diverse objectives through a
variety of pedagogical approaches. Some meditation programs,
including CBCT, teach values such as compassion and kindness, which
are often associated with religious rather than secular virtues.
BISM programs' goals and teaching styles affect the ways that they
constitute their own secular status. At the same time, public
discourse about the proven health benefits of developing kindness
and compassion and the possibility that compassion and kindness are
universal human values--a position championed by the Dalai
Lama--lend further support to the secular status of any BISMs that
teach ethical values and virtues.

CBCT has clear textual antecedents from Tibetan
Buddhism. Therefore, a comparison between the CBCT protocol and one
source text from the Lam rim chen mo by Tsongkhapa
illuminates some of the secularizing choices made in developing
this new meditation program. A parallel between the two
descriptions is evident in a sequence of cognitive and emotional
states that CBCT heartily maintains from its antecedent. Some of
CBCT's researchers have interpreted this cognitive-affective
cascade--including impartiality, gratitude, affection,
love/compassion, and resolve--as evidence that contemplative
traditions uncover and employ the natural propensities of certain
mental and emotional states to amplify subsequent ones. Dynamics of
contrast discernible between Tsongkhapa's text and the CBCT
protocol include subtraction, addition, and rearranging; and each
of these contribute in different ways to CBCT's secularization
process. Analyzing the component decisions that add up to
secularization cannot fail to reveal that the polar opposite
categories of secularity and religion are inadequate to explain a
cultural product such as a meditation training program. Yet, close
attention to secular cultural status and to secularization
processes will be useful to future studies of Buddhist-inflected
secular meditation, because these question address how such
programs represent themselves and how diverse practitioners engage
with them.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- PROLOGUE, 1 -- INTRODUCTION, 4 -- CBCT Program

published,emory:92zd0,"Murray, Ryan","The Effects of CMS on Rats Selectively-bred for Behavior Related to
Bipolar-like and Depression-like Symptoms","The chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm often uses preference for
sucrose as a measure of
hypothesized anhedonia in rats. However, this measure is rife with
unreliability, an issue that
could be due to genetic differences between rats. This study tested
this hypothesis by subjecting
rats selectively bred for affective disorder-like behavior to CMS.
Five lines of rats selectively-
bred for behavior related to affective disorders were used:
Hyperactive (HYPER), Swim-test
Susceptible (SUS), Swim-test Resistant (RES), Swim Low-active
(SwLo), and Swim High-
active (SwHi) rats. The reactions of these selectively-bred lines
to CMS were compared to the
reactions of non-selectively bred (NS) rats which were used as
controls. In addition, both female
and male HYPER and NS rats were examined. Sucrose intake and
preference for sucrose, as
determined by the proportion of total fluid intake that was water
intake, were measured and
analyzed. Food intake and dark and light phase motor activity were
also measured. During
CMS, stressed HYPER rats, both females and males, SUS, RES, and
SwHi rats showed lower
preference for sucrose than did non-stressed rats of the same
lines. In contrast, stressed female
NS rats did not show a different preference for sucrose than
non-stressed female NS rats, and
stressed male NS rats tended to show higher preference for sucrose
than non-stressed male NS
rats. Stressed SwLo rats also did not show a different preference
for sucrose than non-stressed
SwLo rats. The effects on preference for sucrose could not be
explained by a change in caloric
intake as evidenced by patterns in food and water intake. Taken
together, these results suggest
that genetics can influence the outcome of CMS with respect to
effects of stress on preference for
sucrose and thus the known behavioral characteristics of a rat line
should be taken into
consideration when selecting animals for use in CMS
experiments.","Introduction - 1 -- Methods - 5 -- Animals and Housing Conditions -

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BISPHENOL A EXPOSURE AND BONE
MINERAL DENSITY IN POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN,
NHANES 2005-2008
By Juan Li
BACKGROUD: Humans are widely exposed to the
estrogenic/anti-androgen compound
bisphenol A (BPA) through food and drinks packaging. Numerous
studies report that
BPA alters endocrine function in animals, yet data from human
studies is limited.
OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to explore the
association between
BPA exposure and bone mineral density (BMD) in post-menopausal
women.
METHODS: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey
(2005-2008), a population sample of noninstitutionalized U.S.
residents. Post-menopausal
women 50 years of age and older who completed the adult household
questionnaire and
participated in the mobile examination component were included. The
primary outcome
variable was BMD of the total hip. BMD was measured using
dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA). BPA concentration, the exposure, was
measured by liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in urine samples. We fit a
logistic model
with BMD, dichotomized based on the definition of the osteoporosis,
as the outcome and
quartiles of BPA as the exposure. RESULTS: The adjusted odds
ratios comparing the
upper quartiles of BPA (in ascending order) to the lowest quartile
were 1.17 (0.32-4.23),
0.88 (0.22-3.57), and 0.50 (0.12-1.99).
CONCLUSION: We found no association between urine BPA and
BMD in this cross-
sectional study.

published,emory:4wrmp,"Steinberg, Karyn Meltz","Identifying Variants in Neuroligin Pathway Genes Using Next
Generation Sequencing Technologies","The fields of population genomics and evolutionary quantitative
genetics provide a
framework in which one can best pursue the heritable component of
complex human
phenotypes. A central challenge lies in the comprehensive
ascertainment of all the
relevant genomic variation, irrespective of their population
frequency, in a large
collection of human samples. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a
complex human
neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by a high heritability
and a nearly 4:1 male
excess. Applying this comprehensive genomic variation detection
paradigm poses two
main challenges. The first lies in developing and applying
technologies that can
efficiently detect the relevant genomic variation. The second lies
in applying these
methods in the context of a testable genetic hypothesis that might
elucidate the etiology
of ASD. Here I report on a series of studies that have pursued both
of these challenges.
While sequencing technologies have advanced rapidly in the past
decade, the ability to
rapidly isolated target DNA for sequencing has lagged. I first
describe a novel technique
for isolating target DNA for downstream resequencing applications.
This protocol, named
Microarray-based Genomic Selection, is able to efficiently select
user-defined sequence
that is then hybridized to resequencing arrays. Two experiments
that used Microarray-
based Genomic Selection for resequencing are described. In the
first experiment the
technology was used to isolate all of the exons on the X
chromosome, while the second
experiment used it to isolate specific genes in the neuroligin
pathway that are
hypothesized to contribute to ASD. Advantages and limitations of
MGS are discussed. To
address the genetic basis of ASD, I first selected X-linked
neuroligin pathway genes
thought to harbor ASD susceptibility alleles that may help explain
the male excess in
ASD. Using samples of male individuals with ASD obtained from the
Autism Genetic
Resource Exchange (AGRE), I performed paired-end multiplexed
sequencing on the
Illumina Genome Analyzer to comprehensively sequence the genomic
regions containing
the neuroligin pathway genes. This study identified a series of
candidate variants that
may contribute to ASD susceptibility. Finally, I will highlight the
importance of using
quantitative evolutionary genetics when analyzing and interpreting
sequence data.","DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT -- APPROVAL SHEET -- ABSTRACT COVER PAGE --

published,emory:13q9n,"Davidson, Joanna Helen",Feet in the Fire: Social Change and Continuity among the Diola of Guinea-Bissau,"Diola villagers in Guinea-Bissau have long been recognized for their capacity to grow rice in their landscape of tangled mangroves and thick oil palm forests. Recently,
  declining rainfall, desertification, and widespread erosion have increasingly challenged their ability to provision themselves through long-established wet rice cultivation practices. The effects
  of these ecological shifts are exacerbated by increased youth migration, national political instability, and the simultaneous increasing demands of a cash economy and declining overall economic
  security.   Based on two years of ethnographic research in Guinea-Bissau, this dissertation begins with the recognition, shared by most residents in the region, that Diola
  villagers are currently challenged to maintain a way of life that has largely worked well for many centuries. Diola see their sustenance system not simply as a means of survival, but as integrally
  tied to their conceptions of personhood, social relations, ritual obligations, and collective cultural identity. What do Diola villagers do when the actions that define a worthy person are no
  longer tenable? What happens when they find that many of the premises of their society are working against them? How does a cultural group maintain itself  as such
  when the values that have long defined its members are under severe pressure? This ethnography tells a complex and often contradictory story about Diola responses to these challenges by
  examining three central crises underway in Diola-land.  First, I consider Diola responses to changes in their environment that impinge upon their ability to maintain their
  long-held system of rice agriculture. The second part examines Christian missionary presence in Diola-land, and particularly how Diola Christians negotiate the different orientations and
  opportunities of village and mission life. The final section explores a conflict between Diola and Fula residents in this region, and explicates Diola values regarding social incorporation and
  exclusion.   Across these sites of analysis, this study explores which social forms are reproduced, which boundaries are maintained or redrawn, and how such processes are
  continually contested. Through specific ethnographic examples that have direct bearing on current Diola lives these three stories collectively engage broader questions about conflict, social change
  and continuity.","Feet in the Fire: Social Change and Continuity among the Diola of Guinea-Bissau -- Prologue: Feet in the Fire  Part I: Environmental and Economic Crises: Rice and Rain, Labor and Leveling

Two efficient desulfitative cross coupling methodologies were
developed to synthesize
high enantiopurity peptidyl ketones. The first methodology was
developed from the first
generation of the Liebeskind-Srogl desulfitative cross coupling
reaction. In the presence
of catalytic Pd2(dba)3/triethyl phosphite and stoichiometric
Cu(I)-thiophene-2-
carboxylate, a great variety of N-protected peptidyl thiol esters
couple efficiently with
boronic acids to yield the corresponding peptidyl ketones in
satisfactory yields without
racemization or epimerization. In the second generation of
desulfitative peptidyl ketone
synthesis, high enantiopurity peptidyl ketones were synthesized
from peptidyl S-
acylthiosalicylamide esters and boronic acids by using
Cu(I)-3-methylsalicylate as the
only metal catalyst. The reaction takes place at room temperature
under air. Eighteen
examples have been synthesized to demonstrate the efficiency and a
broad tolerance of
functional groups for this new reaction.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1. -- Ambient Temperature Synthesis of

in Evidence-Based Practice Adoption","Abstract
The Magnet Journey: Understanding the Role of Unit Culture in
Evidence-Based Practice Adoption
Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study was to
identify salient cognitive beliefs
and cultural assumptions that affect the emergence and maintenance
of evidence-based
practice (EBP) in the hospital setting.
Scope: The use of EBP does not consistently occur in
the nation's hospitals and this
leads to substandard patient/family outcomes. EBP is a
decision-making process that
integrates the use of best evidence or research, patient/family
preferences, and clinical
expertise. This definition parallels the IOM's calls for
transformation of the healthcare
system to one that is evidence-based and patient/family centered.
Understanding
individual and cultural attributes that influence nurses' behavior
is vital to achieving this
goal.
Methods: This exploratory study utilized a
qualitative approach, consisting of in-depth
interviews of 35 Registered Nurses on adult medical-surgical or
critical care units in a
Magnet journey or Magnet designated hospital in a large
metropolitan area in the
Southeastern US. Data were analyzed using the principles of
analytic ethnography.
Results: The multilevel theoretical model framing
this study was extended and refined
based on the data resulting in the creation of a new multilevel
model. Extensions to the
model included the identification of two antecedent variables:
hospital-level basic
assumptions and unit leader characteristics. Refinements to the
model included
specification of the unit-level culture and individual cognitive
beliefs. New relationships
among all variables were identified.
Significance: The new EBP implementation and
sustainability model provides a more
complete description of how nurses implement and maintain EBP in
the acute care
setting. Further study of the hospital-level culture and unit-level
nurse leader
characteristics is needed to develop effective interventions to
accelerate the use of EBP
in the hospital staff nurses.

health, nutrition, and family planning services","Background: The integration of HIV and maternal, neonatal,
child health and nutrition services
(MNCHN), including family planning (FP) is recognized as a key
strategy to reduce maternal
and child mortality and control the HIV epidemic. However, limited
evidence exists on the
effectiveness of service integration.
Objective: To evaluate the impact of integrating MNCHN-FP
and HIV services on health,
behavioral, and economic outcomes and to identify research
gaps.
Methods: Using the Cochrane Collaboration's validated search
strategies for identifying reports
of HIV interventions, along with appropriate keywords and MeSH
terms, a range of electronic
databases were searched, including CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE,
MEDLINE, and Web of
Science, from January 1990 to October 2010. Included studies were
published in peer-reviewed
journals, and provided intervention evaluation data (pre-post or
multi-arm study design).
Interventions were organizational strategies or change, process
modifications or introductions of
technologies aimed at integrating MNCHN-FP and HIV service
delivery.
Analysis: A total of 10,619 citations were identified from
electronic databases and 101 citations
from hand searching, cross-references and interpersonal
communication. After screening for
relevance, 121 full-text articles were reviewed.
Results: Twenty peer-reviewed articles representing 19
interventions met inclusion criteria.
There were no randomized controlled trials. One study utilized a
stepped wedge design, while
the rest were non-randomized trials, cohort studies, time series,
cross-sectional, serial cross-
sectional and before-after studies. It was not possible to perform
meta-analysis. Risk of bias
was generally high. There was high between-study heterogeneity in
intervention types, study
objectives, settings and designs, and reported outcomes. Most
studies integrated FP with HIV
testing or HIV treatment. Overall, HIV and MNCHN-FP service
integration was feasible across a
variety of integration models, settings and target populations.
Nearly all studies reported positive
post-integration effects on key outcomes including contraceptive
use, HIV treatment initiation,
HIV testing, and quality of services.
Conclusion: This systematic review found that integrated HIV
and MNCHN-FP services were
feasible to implement and can improve a variety of health and
behavioral outcomes. However,
significant evidence gaps remain. Rigorous research comparing
outcomes of integrated with
non-integrated services, including cost-effectiveness, HIV and STI
incidence, morbidity and
mortality are needed to inform programs and policy.","Table of contents --

published,emory:gsvqj,"Alford, Joshua Shane","Expanding the Scope of Donor/Acceptor Carbenes and the Synthesis of
Novel Therapeutic Agents for Cocaine Abuse","Donor/acceptor metallocarbenes are capable of undergoing many
synthetically useful transformations primarily catalyzed by
dirhodium(II) complexes. It is well established that the donor
group plays a crucial role in modulating the reactivity of these
donor/acceptor metallocarbenes. Therefore, it is great interest to
expand the range of the donor groups to heteroatoms; however,
strongly donating groups tend to decrease the thermal stability of
the carbene precursor.
The second chapter is devoted to exploring whether it is
feasible to expand the ""donor"" group to amino or alkoxy
functionality. A major breakthrough in this area was discovered
using a different type of carbene precursor, the N-sulfonyl
triazole. This was a very important advance because these types of
diazo compounds were previously too unstable to be isolated. The
first part describes the development of 4-amino N-sulfonyl
triazoles, which participate in the stereoselective
cyclopropanation of olefins. A variety of alkenes and dienes
undergo a highly diastereoselective cyclopropanation leading to
a-amino cyclopropylcarboxaldehydes in good to
excellent yields. Furthermore, the reaction can be conducted in a
one-pot procedure starting from the N-ethynylphthalimide.
The second part of this chapter describes the extension of this
breakthrough to 4-oxy N-sulfonyl triazoles, which also
participate in an enantioselective cyclopropanation of styrene
derivatives. During these studies, a novel amino acylation reaction
that is specific to this class was discovered. This transformation
includes a multicomponent one-pot cascade reaction creating four
different bonds regioselectively.
The third chapter focuses on extending the N-sulfonyl
triazole methodology for the synthesis of alkenyl carbene
precursors. During these studies, it was discovered that in the
absence of a suitable trapping agent, 4-alkenyl N-sulfonyl
triazoles participate in a rhodium(II)-catalyzed
4p-electrocyclization with the adjacent alkenyl
moiety to furnish 2,3-fused pyrroles. The reaction was further
extended to the synthesis of substituted indoles.
The fourth chapter focuses selective C-H
functionalization of tertiary C-H bonds with
N-sulfonyl triazoles, which are typically inaccessible to
diazoacetates. The change in chemoselectivity towards tertiary
C-H bonds is attributed to the lower steric demand of
the imino carbene compared to the keto carbene.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I: Introduction to Donor/Acceptor

Premiums on Tobacco Cessation","This study attempted to determine if charging tobacco users more
for their health insurance premiums increases tobacco cessation
above predicted levels. A comparison of proportions test examined
the differences in tobacco cessation rates between a cohort who
were charged a tobacco surcharge and the predicted population
cessation rate. The Georgia State Health Benefit Plan (SHBP) began
charging a tobacco surcharge on monthly health insurance premiums
in July 2005. The surcharge was applied to each enrolled employee
who reported tobacco use during the past 12 months by the employee
or by any of the employee's covered dependents (spouse, dependent
children). A cohort of 43,034 SHBP members, who were state
employees, teachers, and school support staff, were followed for 70
months (July 2005 to April 2011). The Department of Community
Health (DCH) provided the raw data (non-identifiable to specific
individuals) used in this research. We found that over the 70
months observation period, 46.3% of the enrollees in the SHBP
cohort reported that all covered family members had quit using
tobacco, a figure that was significantly different than the 13.9%
that would have quit at the predicted national cessation rate.
Sensitivity analysis confirmed this finding when SHBP enrollees
quit in greater numbers when compared to a range of population
cessation rates. We concluded that charging tobacco users a higher
health insurance premium appears to significantly increase tobacco
cessation rates. This study measures self-reported cessation and
most likely overestimates the impact of the tobacco surcharge on
cessation, but sensitivity analysis indicates that the central
findings of this study hold true. This is the first study to employ
empirical data to examine the effect of charging higher health
insurance premiums to tobacco users and provides evidence that this
rapidly spreading practice may improve the public health by
increasing tobacco cessation.","Contents -- Introduction -- Literature Review --

published,emory:fkr94,"Ball, Kelly Hudgins","""So Powerful a Form"": Rethinking Girls' Sexuality","Contemporary debates in feminist psychology situate girls'
sexuality as a point of both vulnerability and empowerment. This
project uses queer and feminist theory to examine the concepts of
girls' sexuality that drive feminist psychologies of girlhood and
the multi-disciplinary field of girls' studies. Focusing on the
girl as a liminal figure, my analysis revolves around what I refer
to as the paradox of girlhood: in Western modernity, girlhood is
imagined as being a pre-sexual developmental age of innocence that
needs to be protected and, at the same time, a period of intense
sexual desire that needs to be expressed. My dissertation contests
this overly reductive picture of girlhood as a split between
freedom and constraint, agency and victimization. In doing so, it
complicates accepted understandings of girlhood across disciplines
and within queer and feminist theories specifically, and reveals
previously unrecognized assumptions about the relationship between
sexuality and subjectivity more broadly. My dissertation explores
the epistemic power the paradox of girlhood generates and the
limits of the binarisms it exposes by examining how this paradox
informs feminist scholarship on girls, and more generally, feminist
and queer theories of sexuality. To accomplish this, I employ
philosophical research methods, combined with secondary source
analysis of scientific literature, to examine the overlapping
histories of childhood, sexuality, and psychology. ""So Powerful a
Form"" thus investigates the figure of the girl, locating her at the
beginnings of developmental psychology and the proliferation of
sexological categories during the late 19th century. My
dissertation establishes a queer-feminist analytic lens to
problematize cultural citations of sexuality as a source of
girlhood empowerment. As I contend, the figure of the girl resists
a simple teleological reading as always already on the way to
womanhood and the concomitant promise of becoming a stable,
psychosexual subject. Moreover, building upon the insights of queer
theory, I read the girl as a figure whose precarious position as no
longer a child and not yet a woman opens new possibilities
for theorizing the relationships among subjectivity, sexuality, and
girlhood.","Table of Contents --

Pathogenesis","Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), the etiologic agent
of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), was responsible for
1.6 million deaths in 2012, and there are over 35 million people
worldwide currently living with HIV. HIV is a life-long, chronic
viral infection characterized by a steady decline in CD4+ T cells
resulting in a state of overt immunodeficiency. Despite the fact
that a majority of HIV-1 infected individuals eventually progress
to AIDS, they do so at varying rates, implying that host or viral
factors may alter the trajectory of disease. Here, we study acute
HIV-1 infection in a cohort of Zambian volunteers in order to
define the complex interplay between transmitted viral
characteristics and the host immune response and their influence on
HIV-1 pathogenesis.
Here, we demonstrate that viral replicative capacity (vRC), as
defined by the viral Gag protein, has a dramatic impact on HIV-1
disease progression, in that high vRC is associated with elevated
plasma viral loads and accelerated loss of CD4+ T cells.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that vRC drives multiple facets of
HIV-1 immunopathology. High vRC initiates an exacerbated
inflammatory state characterized by increased levels of
inflammatory cytokines, aberrant T cell activation phenotypes, and
increased infection of central memory CD4+ T cells.
Events dictated by vRC can be further modulated by the host's
cellular immune response. In this same cohort we identify novel
immunogenetic factors associated with significant protection from
CD4+ T cell decline. Interestingly, these alleles exert a
protective effect without significantly controlling plasma viral
load, suggesting an alternate mechanism. Indeed, we find that in
the earliest stages of infection, these protective immunogenetic
factors are associated with reduced markers of gut damage and
microbial translocation, which are known to contribute to chronic
immune activation in HIV infection.
These data expand our current knowledge of the viral and host
characteristics that influence the trajectory of HIV-1 pathogenesis
and specifically highlight the importance of early events post
transmission, which dramatically impact the course of disease.
Furthermore, these results suggest that vaccine-induced immune
responses or interventional therapeutics capable of attenuating
early viral replication may have a significant, long-term benefit
for the host.",

Social Change and Musical Classification Systems:
The US, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, 1955-2005
By Vaughn C. Schmutz

This dissertation addresses the relationship between broad
dimensions of social change
and the ways in which music is classified in four countries from
1955 to 2005. In
particular, the substantive chapters examine the impact of
globalization,
commercialization, and social heterogeneity and inequality on the
relative position of
classical and popular music in each country, the cultural
legitimacy of various actors and
music genres, and the extent of hierarchy and differentiation in
the musical field.
Drawing extensively on content analysis of newspapers in the four
countries in reference
years between 1955 and 2005, this dissertation shows that popular
music has gained
considerable cultural legitimacy in the four countries, although
the extent and timing of
this trend varies. In addition, this dissertation demonstrates that
the four countries
demonstrate a greater international orientation to popular music
actors, while remaining
highly focused on the affluent centers of music production in
popular music and more
oriented to domestic and European actors in classical music (see
chapter 2). Trends
toward greater commercialization in cultural production are shown
to occur alongside the
growing autonomy of music critics and a greater tendency to adopt a
critical, evaluative
perspective on popular music (see chapter 3). Chapter 4 represents
a rare attempt to
empirically test Paul DiMaggio's influential theory of artistic
classification systems. The
chapter indicates that social heterogeneity and inequality have
both expected and
unexpected relationships to the extent of differentiation and
hierarchy evident in the
musical classification systems of the four countries. In general,
the dissertation builds on
cross-national comparative research to add to our understanding of
the relationship
between social change and processes of cultural legitimacy and
classification.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Chapter one -- 1 -- Introduction: Social

Size Matters. Does Number? Magnitude Perception and Dominance
Judgments.

Social animals develop social structures so they can organize their
environment. Following these
structures, animals must make decisions based on dominance. Those
who are more dominant
have priority access to desirable objects such as food and mates.
Previous research suggests that
human infants and other non-human animals are able to use certain
information, such as physical
size and number, to determine dominance. The current study examined
how 3-year-olds, 5-year-
olds, and adults used physical size and numerical information to
determine which of two groups
was dominant. When presented alone, 3-year-olds and adults were
able to use number and
physical size to make dominance judgments. When pitted against each
other, these participants
showed a preference for physical size, at least when the groups
consisted of relatively few
individuals. Five-year-olds, however, focused on number to make
dominance judgments. These
results suggest that there is an early basis for the ability to use
magnitude information to
represent dominance and that learning may affect the relative
saliency of magnitudes when
judging dominance.","Table of Contents --

coin issues, architecture, cameos, statuary, public events, and
literature dealing with Minerva

However,
more recent studies have emerged reporting contradictory

Results. Overall, these studies indicate that in comparison
to
those who have never smoked, past and current smokers are at
increased risk of mucinous, but not serous or endometrioid
ovarian
cancers. Additionally, increased smoking increases the risk
of
mucinous ovarian cancers.
Conclusion. The literature to date suggests that women
who
smoke are approximately twice as likely to develop mucinous
ovarian
cancers compared with women who have never smoked. Primary
prevention of mucinous ovarian cancer is possible with an
adjustment
in behavior, as smoking is a modifiable risk factor.

an Enabling Restriction in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Lord
Jim, and The Secret Agent","While identification of paradox in Conrad's work is significant,
it is more important to ask what it is doing. Conrad posits the
human experience as inscrutable. His characters, forced to confront
the uncertain world, always fail. Though this sense of inevitable
failure has invited interpretation of Conrad as pessimistic--and
even nihilistic--there is a recognizable pattern that governs the
failure he presents. Conrad's characters are depicted as moral, law
abiding citizens of society. The social systems that organize their
world, whether they are moral or legal, always fail them. Revealed
as insufficient, the systems are gestured to as the source of
paradox and contradiction in Conrad's fictional worlds. I argue,
however, that, while it is significant that these systems are
flawed, it is even more telling that Conrad's characters never
cease to rely on them.
Conrad portrays identity as the human quality that does not
allow his characters to escape the need to rely on these hopelessly
flawed systems. Identity is positioned as the narrative by which
the individual understands himself and the world around him; it
allows the individual to face the uncertainty that Conrad sees in
the world. Identity, however, is not able to transcend the social
systems that organize the world, as they are the only tools
available that can make the world appear intelligible. Marlow is
Conrad's only character who seems capable of identifying this
restriction, yet he is unable to face the uncertain world without
identity. That Marlow's critical capacity falls short, as he
chooses to retreat within a consoling fiction rather than attempt
to imagine criteria independent from the ordering systems of his
society by which he can identify himself, exhibits the totalizing
nature of the inscrutability that, for Conrad, defines humanity.
Identity enables the individual to function within an uncertain
world, but it also restricts him from being able to understand that
world and the forces that act upon him within it.","Introduction 1 -- Contextualizing Failure: The Paradoxical Creation

Dead at Shingleroof Camp Meeting","Shingleroof Camp Meeting in Henry County, Georgia, founded in
the 1820s, endures in the early
twenty-first century as a distinctive and distinguishable religious
culture in which ancestors play
prominent roles. This multimedia ethnography and cultural history
explores the relationships between the
living and the dead at Shingleroof, analyzing the camp meeting as a
cult of ancestor veneration
and embodied collective remembering while maintaining a focus on
the interplay of bodies and
memory, practices and place.

From the starting point of an explicit ancestor-venerating
religious culture, Obon, the Japanese
Buddhist festival of the dead, as observed in rural northern
Hiroshima, as comparand, the
dissertation identifies Shingleroof as a religious culture in which
ancestor veneration, while more
implicit, is constitutive of the camp meeting's particular ethos.
Reasons for the lack of attention
to ancestors in the study of North American religions generally are
surveyed as well as reasons
behind the obscurity of camp meetings in US culture today despite
the many and diverse cultural
forms that descend from them. A history of the camp meeting form
argues against the dominant
narrative, locating the Southeast as its birth region, and a
history of the camp meeting movement,
roughly 1800-1840, examines the key role of ecumenism and other
characteristics of the early
meetings. A narrative history of Shingleroof reveals it as an
exemplar of the meetings founded
during the movement with a distinctive story of its own.
Shingleroof's religious places and
practices are analyzed separately in writing and together through a
series of nine observational
films.

This project is the first monograph-length study of a single camp
meeting that provides analysis
of practices and places in addition to an examination of history,
the first camp meeting insider
ethnography, and the first study of one camp meeting as a
particular and peculiar religious culture
in its own right. In addition, it is the first Emory doctoral
dissertation in the Graduate Division of
Religion to include original ethnographic film and other original
media as part of the analysis and
one of the two first Emory doctoral dissertations in any area to do
so.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- . -- PREVIEW -- Sounds and Images from

published,emory:90wmg,"Herrick, Kirsten Anne","Maternal Anthropometry and Adverse Perinatal Outcomes in Chinese
Women","Low birth weight, macrosomia and cesarean delivery confer
serious consequences to
mothers and infants. Epidemiological evidence associates maternal
anthropometry, namely
height, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and gestational weight
gain (GWG) with the
adverse outcomes: low birth weight (LBW), macrosomia and cesarean
delivery (CD) in Europoid
populations. However there is a dearth of information on these
associations among Chinese
women which may not function identically as observed in Europoid
populations. For example,
rates of CD in China are among the highest of any developing
country at 46%. The prevalence of
LBW is uncharacteristically low for a developing country, roughly
3%. Macrosomia, at the
opposite end of the birth weight spectrum, has yet to see a large
increase.
Using data from a large prospective cohort of pregnant women
(n=247,831) we found
that recommendations for GWG, derived in the US population, did not
adequately identify
Chinese women at risk of CD or delivering a macrosomic infant;
however, they satisfactorily
identified women at risk of delivering a LBW infant. To understand
why the recommendations
were not well suited for Chinese women, we undertook an examination
of maternal pre-
pregnancy BMI and height and focused solely on the outcome of CD.
We found that the risk for
CD increased at a considerably lower pre-pregnancy BMI than
previously thought. Additionally,
the impact of GWG on CD depends on pre-pregnancy BMI, such that
high GWG is more
deleterious in heavier women compared with leaner women. Maternal
height was also found to
increase the risk of CD; however, we were unable to identify a
threshold where risk increased
dramatically.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes are important endpoints and
predictors of future health for
both mothers and infants. Development of appropriate guidelines for
maternal anthropometry is a
good investment since the period prior to and during pregnancy
provides an opportunity to
mitigate risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Additional
research is needed to develop
adequate GWG guidelines tailored for Chinese women. Research should
focus on the impact of
the changing distribution of body weight and the growing prevalence
of obesity in China.","Table of Contents --

Metaphors in 1 Corinthians","In this dissertation, I argue that Paul's use of
citizenship motifs throughout 1 Corinthians indicates the apostle's
attempt to provide an egalitarian apparatus that deconstructs
Corinthian concern with socioeconomic status. Part One
contends that Paul fashions a citizen body in both civic and
individual aspects in 1 Corinthians. Building off the
legacy of the Jewish politeuma, Paul envisions
the ""churches of God"" as a polity distinct from those
of the cities in which the house-churches found themselves.
He accomplishes this by means of references to
paideia, law courts, and Greek athletic games.
Just as Jewish gymnasia replicated the
features of the Greek gymnasium while maintaining Jewish
regulations such as halakhic oil, Paul presents the Christian
gymnasium as one that reproduces the features of the Greek games
but with results more durable than those of the temporally bound
and perishable polis. This
political construction of citizenship serves as Paul's response to
the schisms in the community that are reproducing social
inequalities in Roman Corinth. Part Two explores
Paul's construction of the Christian politeuma
and the Christian citizen through his athletic imagery in 1
Corinthians. Part Three of the work addresses the
manner in which Paul's veiling instructions intersected with Roman
imperial ideology concerned with the visual display of
status. In Chapter Six, I discuss how Paul's
justification for Christian veiling practices by means of the
Genesis creation accounts parallels the imperial ideology that
supported veiling customs with the creation accounts.
Chapter Seven situates Paul's concluding appeal to the social
customs of the ""churches of God"" within the context of veiling
customs in the early imperial period.",
published,emory:pktp3,"Whalen, Kristine Abigail","Paleolithic Diet Scoring and Associations with Inflammation,
Colorectal Adenomas, and Mortality","Homo sapiens may be more biologically
adapted to the general diet that
they would have eaten prior to the development
of agriculture, the ""Paleolithic diet"". Yet few studies have
examined this dietary pattern and any potential benefits it may
have in reducing risk for modern chronic diseases.
In the first study, we investigated associations of two diet
pattern scores, the Paleolithic and the Mediterranean, with
circulating levels of two inflammation-related biomarkers, CRP and
F2-isoprostanes, in a pooled cross-sectional study of an
elective outpatient colonoscopy population (N=646). We found
statistically significant trends for decreasing mean plasma
biomarker concentrations with increasing quintiles of the
Paleolithic and Mediterranean diet scores.
In the second study, we assessed associations of the two diet
scores with prevalent incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas in a
case-control study (n=2,301) of colorectal polyps. The adjusted
odds ratios comparing those in the highest to the lowest quintiles
of the diet scores were, respectively, 0.71 (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 0.50, 1.02; Ptrend=0.02) and 0.74 (95%
CI: 0.54, 1.03; Ptrend=0.05) when comparing the cases to
the endoscopy-negative controls, and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.26;
Ptrend=0.14) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.11;
Ptrend=0.13) when comparing the cases to the community
controls.
In the third study, we investigated associations of the
Paleolithic and the Mediterranean diet scores with all-cause and
cause-specific mortality in a longitudinal cohort of adults
(REGARDS; n=21,423). During a median follow-up of 6.25 years, 2,513
participants died. The adjusted hazard ratios comparing those in
the highest to those in the lowest quintiles of the diet scores
were, respectively, 0.77 (95% CI 0.67, 0.89;
Ptrend&lt;0.01) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.54, 0.73;
Ptrend&lt;0.01).
The results of these studies suggest that more Paleolithic- or
Mediterranean-like diet patterns may be associated with lower
levels of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress; lower risk
for incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas; and lower risk of
all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Overall, this dissertation
contributes to our understanding of Paleolithic diet patterns by
creating the first such diet pattern score and using it to assess
the diet's association with risk of chronic disease.","LIST OF FIGURES -- LIST OF TABLES -- Chapter

THREE ESSAYS ON CORPORATE BOARDS

By

Seoyoung Kim


My purpose is to examine the composition and structure of corporate
boards, and their
implications for firm performance and monitoring and disciplinary
effectiveness. In my
first essay, I explore the nature and extent of financially
affiliated directors' involvement
within the board. I find that affiliated directors are given
substantially greater committee
involvement when the CEO is directly involved in apportioning
committee assignments,
and their involvement is negatively associated with firm value and
subsequent operating
performance. In my second essay, I examine how social ties affect a
director's capacity to
objectively monitor and discipline the CEO. I find that CEOs enjoy
higher compensation
packages that are less sensitive to performance when they share
social ties with members
of the board. In my third essay, I examine how social ties affect
the financial-reporting
process, as well as how firms respond to increased regulatory
constraints concerning
board and committee composition. I find that social ties between
the CEO and members
of the audit committee contribute to higher levels of earnings
management. Moreover, I
find that audit committees appointing socially affiliated
replacements (for the departing
conventionally affiliated members) in the post Sarbanes Oxley
period manage earnings
more than those that do not, suggesting the growing importance of
social ties as an
alternate, unregulated attempt by which CEOs capture the financial
reporting process.

published,emory:b4qj0,"Schroeder, Mary Chen",The Economics of Mandated Paid Leave,"In 2002, California became the first state to mandate a paid leave
policy, providing partial wage
replacement while for those who are employed but not at work. By
exploiting this quasi-natural
experiment, I am able to estimate the causal impact of the policy
on a number of economic
outcomes. First, the policy reduced the costs of family formation
for working mothers while
simultaneously increasing the cost of hiring fertile women.
Economic theory would predict that the
demand for and supply of labor would be affected by the policy. The
magnitudes of the labor
demand and supply curve shifts depend on the valuation and the cost
of the benefit. Any shift will
affect the wages and employment of the affected group. Empirical y,
I find that the wages and
employment of married women and those with children did decrease
after the policy was
implemented. My results using men as the comparison group suggest a
rather different story than
that seen above based on alternative female control groups. None of
the wage estimates is
significant, while the employment estimates when significant are
both positive and negative. Second,
providing paid leave could also affect health outcomes as a
mother's allocation of time towards
health production depends on the relative prices of the inputs.
Thus I also examine how paid leave
affected the self reported health status of mothers and their
children. I find no significant effects,
though the lack of statistical significance may be driven by my
small sample size. Third, though the
policy was enacted in September 2002, it was not until July 2004
that the first benefits were
disbursed. This ""announcement period"" al ows direct measure of the
causal impact of anticipating
paid leave on the timing of births. I estimate a 0.099 percentage
point decrease in the monthly
fertility rate in California for women ages 24-49 during the
announcement period, suggesting that
women did indeed postpone childbearing in order to receive more
generous leave.","LIST OF FIGURES -- LIST OF TABLES -- Chapter -- 1. INTRODUCTION

Motoneurons","Delayed Treadmill Training and Synaptic Stripping of Axotomized
Motoneurons
By Natalee Kay Wilson
When a peripheral nerve is injured, sensory and motor axons in the
periphery are disconnected from the central nervous system (CNS).
In addition, synaptic inputs withdraw from the somata and proximal
dendrites of the injured motoneuron, a process known as synaptic
stripping. After moderate daily treadmill training, the expected
loss of synaptic inputs onto axotomized motoneurons due to synaptic
stripping is not observed. Whether this effect of treadmill
training is due to the prevention of the withdrawal of synaptic
inputs or a restoration of synapses is not clear. In this study,
the onset of treadmill training was delayed until one week
following peripheral nerve transection. At that time, substantial
withdrawal of synapses from the axotomized motoneurons had
occurred. The ability of treadmill training to restore synapses
onto these motoneurons was evaluated. Synaptic coverage was assayed
by measuring the proportion of somata and proximal dendrites of
retrogradely labeled motoneurons covered by terminals
immunopositive for markers of excitatory VGLUT1 and inhibitory
GAD67 synapses. The coverage of axotomized motoneurons by terminals
containing VGLUT1 in delayed trained mice was similar to that found
in intact controls, suggesting a restoration of VGLUT1+ boutons
onto the somata and proximal dendrites of the motoneuron. The
expected loss of GAD67+ boutons that was observed in axotomized
motoneurons in untrained mice was not found in trained mice,
strongly suggesting that the delayed treadmill training had a
restorative effect. Thus, if treadmill training is delayed by one
week after nerve transection, the anticipated loss of synaptic
coverage on the axotomized motoneurons does not occur. This is
evidence for treadmill training having a restorative effect on the
stripped synapses.

published,emory:d83bn,"Pennington, Whitney Claire",A Descriptive Study of Salmonella in Passerines in Urban Atlanta,"Salmonella spp. is a genus of gram-negative, zoonotic
bacterium with over 2,300 known serotypes. Though a leading cause
of foodborne illness in humans, Salmonella enterica
infection is of particular concern in birds. Field studies have
found Salmonella background carriage rate to be as high as
8.5% in populations of passerines (songbirds) that are gregarious
and live near livestock or urban areas. In these urban settings, it
is widely accepted that feeding stations are associated with an
increase of avian salmonellosis, specifically wintertime
Salmonella Typhimurium outbreaks; however, it is unknown if
feeders are increasing the background carriage rate of
Salmonella. In this study we seek to quantify this
background carriage rate by capturing and collecting feces from
songbirds captured by mist net across four sites in urban Atlanta
(Fulton and Dekalb counties). Specifically, we describe the cohort
of passerines captured and outline the association between
Salmonella carriage and other gram-negative enterobacteria
and selected environmental and ornithological risk factors. We
found no association between infection and sex, age, or feeding
guild of bird samples. We did not find correlation between
infection and the canopy cover within 500 meters of bird capture or
the average number of feeders per house within each sample area.
Furthermore, we found no bacterial contamination of the birds
feeders located in the yards where birds were sampled. Further
studies aimed at describing avian bacterial transmission in the
urban environment can build on this study of 135 birds at 4
locations by selecting an alternative bacterial pathogen of
focus.","Table of Contents -- INTRODUCTION

published,emory:1dpcf,"Tan, David","Status Ambiguity and Conflict in the Market
","My main theoretical contention is that status hierarchies
provide a source of guidance to firms for resolving disputes. A
status hierarchy implies a system of deference rules among firms.
When disputes arise, deference rules can provide a basis for shared
expectations and protocols of conduct about how technical
ambiguities should be resolved. In many contexts, technical merit
is difficult to assess. However, deference rules can operate as
social conventions to which firms default, helping to align
potentially incompatible expectations.
Within this general framework, my dissertation examines how
competitors in the semiconductor industry manage uncertain and
frequently overlapping patent rights. In practice, patent rights
are highly imperfect legal instruments when it comes to demarcating
each firm's contributions to innovation in the industry. Patent
disputes arise because of the ambiguity this creates about how much
of the collective market returns to innovation each firm is
entitled to receive. Despite the prolific patenting and propensity
for disputes, the industry has remarkably not ground to a halt from
runaway litigation. Litigation events, while significant, are
rare.
I suggest that this degree of order is, at least partly,
attributable to status processes. Status can operate as a
stabilizing force in the market, helping to generate orderly
competition in the face of disputes. To examine whether this is the
case in the semiconductor industry, I theorize that disputes are
less easily resolved when the parties involved face greater status
ambiguity, i.e. are less clearly differentiated from one another in
status. Under status ambiguity, deference rules lose the rule-like,
universal quality that makes them persuasive in resolving disputes.
This has two consequences. First, firms facing low status ambiguity
are less likely to be involved in patent litigation than are firms
facing high status ambiguity. Patent litigation events represent
failures to resolve patent disputes out of court. Second, firms
facing low status ambiguity increase their product line sizes more
than do firms facing high status ambiguity. The threat of
difficult-to-resolve patent disputes represents a cost that can
deter firms from bringing products to market.","Chapter 1: Introduction . 1 -- Chapter 2: Ambiguity in the context

the myeloid lineage","Abstract
CIITA promoter I and isoform I expression and function in cells of
the myeloid lineage
The major histocompatibility class II transactivator (CIITA) is
controlled by three promoters (pI, pIII, and pIV). Each promoter
encodes a unique first exon, spliced into a common second exon,
resulting in three isoforms that differ only at the N-terminus. The
first exon of isoform I, expressed primarily by myeloid cells
(dendritic cells and macrophages), encodes a region with homology
to a caspase recruitment domain (CARD). The CARD domain is a
protein-protein interaction domain, and is commonly associated with
proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis. The activity and
function of isoform I has not been well studied, and it has been
suggested that the CARD domain enhances CIITA activity. To address
whether CIITA isoform I has a unique function, a mouse model in
which isoform I was replaced with isoform III was generated. In
addition, a mouse line in which the promoter and first exon of
Ciita pI were deleted was also created. No defects in the
formation of CD4 T cells or in responses to viral or bacterial
challenge were seen in mice lacking isoform I. In addition, in the
pI knockout model, only a slight decrease in Ciita and
MHC-II expression was observed in dendritic cells, and no change in
expression was observed in macrophages. These results suggest that
control of pI is mediated by an unknown distal enhancer element
that is also capable of promoting transcription from pIII. Recent
work in our lab and others has identified a regulatory region, HSS1
(DNase hypersensitivity site 1), which is required for
transcription of pIII in B cells and pIV in IFN-γ induced HeLa
cells. Analysis of chromatin structure at the CIITA locus suggests
that HSS1 may also interact with CIITA pI. In B cells, CIITA pI
silencing is likely due to heavy methylation at this promoter. In
non-hematopoietic cells, pIV is inactive unless IFN-γ induced
transcription factors are present. Thus, HSS1 may be a master
enhancer for CIITA, the activity of which is mediated by
methylation and availability of transcription factors.","Table of Contents -- Abstract -- Acknowledgements -- List of

A Cost Benefit analysis of medical

Federal Poverty Level.
BY
RAPHAEL AYEGBA AGBALI R.Ph
Hospital discharge to community level
primary health transition planning has been increasingly identified
as a potentially modifiable area for healthcare outcomes
improvement. Benefits and costs of a free clinic program from
societal perspective are frequently taken for granted as charitable
safety nets.
The US healthcare environment is
undergoing rapid change and different stakeholders strive to
project into the future with some degree of certainty. Economic
evaluations help illuminate viable interventions in this
setting.
Methods: This study utilized referral
log and aggregate medical recent hospitalization data from the
Partnership Health Clinic to compare post referral costs and
benefits between patients who enrolled in free clinic care and
non-adherent patients who did not enroll. 30 day all cause
readmission was the clinical measure. Both groups had no insurance
and no primary care physician. Readmission costs were estimated
using the uninsured dataset of the Healthcare Utilization project
(HCUP) database for 2011 then matched to actual length of stay for
each study group. cost to charge ratios from MedPAR were used to
obtain real life estimates.Household income data for Lowndes County
were obtained from the US Census fact finder and clinic
transportation estimated from the Georgia non-emergency medical
workers compensation transportation allowable rates
2013.
Results: Total referred patient sample
was 58 (Clinic enrolled= 26; non-enrolled=32). Net cost of
prevented readmission was $16,377.12 for the enrolled patient group
with a net financial benefit of $3,890.9 compared to the
non-enrolled group (p=0.49). Net difference in hospital length of
stay between groups was 25 days while the baseline readmission rate
was found to be 25.86 % with readmission rate in the non-enrolled
was 34.37%.
Summary: A collaborative discharge
transition plan between the South Georgia Medical Center and the
charitable Partnership Health Clinic in Valdosta, Georgia generates
cost savings to society. Increased enrollment has the capacity to
further lower fixed costs, generating future savings to
society.","TABLE OF CONTENTS

published,emory:bsqnq,"Vance, Katie Marie",Mechanisms of GluN2D subunit-specific control of synaptic signaling,"NMDA receptors are members of a class of ionotropic glutamate
receptors that also
includes AMPA, kainate, and delta receptors. NMDA receptors mediate
the slow
component of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central
nervous system and have a
role in learning, memory, and neuronal development. Two
glycine-binding GluN1
subunits assemble with two glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits to form
a functional
NMDA receptor, while the four GluN2 subunits (GluN2A-D) control a
majority of the
properties of the receptor. GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors have
an unusually slow
deactivation time course following the removal of L-glutamate and
low channel open
probability compared to the other GluN2 subunits. This dissertation
focuses on the
molecular mechanisms that control the key properties of
GluN1/GluN2D NMDA
receptors and how these properties contribute to the synaptic
activity of the subthalamic
nucleus. The data presented here show that the deactivation time
course of
GluN1/GluN2D NMDA receptors is ligand-dependent, with L-glutamate
causing a
slower deactivation time course than any other linear ligand
evaluated. RNA splicing of
the GluN1 amino-terminal domain also controls the deactivation time
course, agonist
EC50, and channel open probability of GluN1/GluN2D receptors. A
gating scheme of
NMDA receptor activation is presented that describes the key
characteristics of
GluN1/GluN2D NMDA receptor gating as well as identifies specific
rate constants
controlled by the GluN1 amino-terminal domain. Finally, the data
presented here suggest
that GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors contribute to the
excitatory postsynaptic
currents of the subthalamic nucleus.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Background -- 1 -- 1.1. Abstract --

Religiosidades en Tránsito: el simulacro aljamiado en el siglo
XVI español
By María del Mar Rosa-Rodríguez
This dissertation examines Islam, Judaism, and Christianity as
portrayed in Aljamiado
Literature, Judeo-Spanish Literature, and a 1504 fatwa. These
uncanny and hybrid texts exist on
the borderline between the alphabet of one language and the sound
of another (e.g. Spanish
written with Arabic letters or Spanish written in Hebrew
characters). This dissertation focuses
exclusively on Aljamiado Literature and intends to map out the
religiosities in transit of sixteenth-
Century Spain through the hybridity of language in this literature.
The first chapter deals with the
linguistic diversity in Aljamiado writings, creating a theoretical
framework of the Aljamiado
simulacra. The second chapter discusses several Aljamiado legends
and treatises that illustrate
religious overlaps between Islam, Judaism and Christianity. The
third chapter addresses the
religious subjectivities of sixteenth-century Spain produced by the
acts of simulation and
dissimulation and the discussion of a 1504 fatwa from the Mufti of
Oran. The dissertation
includes several original transcriptions from Aljamiado to Spanish.
These texts reveal covert and
subversive gestures of religious and linguistic transit, contrary
to the hegemonic definition of
Imperial Spain. Based on six years of extensive archival research
in Madrid, this dissertation
incorporates these marginalized texts into the Spanish literary
history and explains the religious
passing that takes place when a subject lives between the
simulation of Catholicism, and the
dissimulation of Islam and Judaism. [In Spanish]","Religiosidades en Tránsito: el simulacro aljamiado en el siglo

The Effects of Rodent Maternal Separation on Consumption and
Motivation for Sucrose
Reward and Its Relationship to Anxiety
By Kelly Dixon Watts
There is evidence that an adverse early-life environment is
associated with susceptibility
to anxiety and depression later in life. Separation of rat pups
from their mother during
early development may lead to an exaggerated stress response and
increased anxiety in
adulthood. Recent studies suggest that maternal separation also
alters reward behavior.
These experiments tested whether maternal separation would alter
both anxiety and
motivation to obtain sucrose reward in adulthood. On postnatal days
2-14, Long-Evans
rat pups were subjected to either 180 min of maternal separation
(HMS 180), 15 min of
separation (HMS 15), animal facility raised (AFR), or unhandled
(UNH). Adult male
offspring were tested for anxiety-like behaviors on the open field
and elevated plus maze
(EPM), locomotor activity, sucrose preference, and operant
responding for sucrose at
increasing fixed-ratio (FR) requirements. HMS 180 had increased
anxiety in both the
open field and elevated plus maze compared to AFR and UNH. UNH had
increased
locomotion compared to HMS 15 and HMS 180. No rearing group
differences were
observed in preference for sucrose solution in the home cage.
However, HMS 180 rats
took significantly longer than UNH to eat freely available sucrose
pellets in the operant
chamber. Anxiety measures correlated with initial sucrose
consumption in the novel
chamber. There were no differences in acquisition, in responding at
any fixed-ratio requirement, or in extinction. However,
anxiety measures on the EPM and the open field correlated
significantly with operant
responding at both low and high ratio requirements across groups.
This suggests that even in rats
habituated to the test setting, anxiety is associated with lower
levels of responding for
sucrose. Together, these observations suggest that maternal
separation consistently leads
to increased anxiety, which correlates with delayed initial
response to sucrose reward in a
novel environment. While no group differences were observed on
operant responding for
sucrose, anxiety was associated with lower incentive motivation
across animals.","Table of Contents -- Introduction --

On the Frontier of ""Freedom:"" Abolition and the Transformation of
Atlantic Commerce
in Southern Sierra Leone, 1790s to 1860s
By Philip R. Misevich
This study examines the impact of transformations in Atlantic
commerce on
Africans living in southern Sierra Leone between 1790 and 1861.
Extant studies of 19th
century Africa have outlined a linear progression from the
suppression of the slave trade
to the rise of ""legitimate commerce,"" leading ultimately to
Africa's colonization. My
dissertation argues that in their effort to suppress the Sierra
Leone slave trade, British
officials were forced to intervene in the political affairs of
Freetown's interior, opening
new spaces for slaves to challenge their owners and negotiate new
rights for themselves.
In Sierra Leone, the relationship between the suppression of the
slave trade, colonialism
and slavery was time and again re-forged based on actions taken by
slaves, masters and
colonists in the first half of the century.
The study begins with an analysis of changes in the coastal
organization of slave
exports in the 19th century and their effect on the African
interior. The establishment of
Freetown - a settlement that became Britain's first African colony
and a point from which
the British attempted to suppress the slave trade ­ brought
drastic changes to the
operation of the Sierra Leone slave trade. Slave dealers moved away
from the Sierra
Leone River, where Freetown was based, and operated from new
settlements in southern
Sierra Leone. The rise of Gallinas and Sherbro as slave ports put
new pressures on
societies in their immediate hinterland, from which a majority of
the region's captives
came.
Southern Sierra Leone's external slave trade developed together
with a dynamic
market for slaves in the African interior in the 19th century. The
Atlantic slave trade
stimulated demand for agricultural commodities produced in southern
Sierra Leone.
Sherbro farmers also supplied Freetown with hundreds of tons of
rice each year. When
the Atlantic slave trade ended, southern Sierra Leone's internal
slave trade evolved to
meet domestic needs. From the 1830s thorough the 1860s, Islamic
slave dealers began
transporting thousands of captives from the Gallinas and Sherbro to
work on peanut
plantations north of Freetown. As a result, southern Sierra Leone
slaves became an
important part of fueling the industrial revolution.","Table of Contents -- Introduction, 1 -- Chapter 1. Southern Sierra

published,emory:g10hm,"Dorfman, Haley Lauren","The association between diabetes mellitus among American
Indian/Alaska Native populations with preterm birth in eight U.S.
states from 2004-2011","Background: American Indians and
Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest prevalence of diabetes
mellitus (DM) in the United States. Previous research has indicated
that women with prepregnancy DM or gestational DM are at increased
risk for poor perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB).
Disparities in preterm birth between racial/ethnic groups are well
documented; however, data on the association of maternal risk
factors and poor perinatal outcomes within AI/AN women is
limited.
Methods: We utilized surveillance data
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy
Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) to assess whether DM is
associated with PTB among AI/AN women in Alaska, Minnesota,
Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah and Washington from
2004-2011. We further examined whether this association differed
between states.Using a population-based retrospective cohort
of 12,420 live singleton births to AI/AN women we conducted
backwards elimination and forward selection to construct a
multivariable logistic regression model that estimates the odds of
preterm birth among women with DM compared to women without DM.
Results: Women with DM had 1.83 (95%
CI: 1.21-2.78, p = 0.004) times the odds of having a preterm birth
than women without DM after controlling for maternal age and
prepregnancy BMI. After stratifying on state, women with DM in
Nebraska had the greatest odds of preterm birth (aOR = 6.63, p =
0.00) while AI/AN women in Alaska had a protective effect of DM
(aOR = 0.17, p = 0.00).
Discussion: This finding suggests a
misreporting or lack of adequate diagnosis of DM and GDM in Alaska.
Our results indicate a significant association of DM with preterm
birth in AI/AN women. Differences across states call for increased
surveillance, assessment of health data quality, and public health
efforts in high-risk areas. Further research is needed to compare
these results to other minority populations and to assess whether
differences across states can be attributed to tribal, healthcare
or lifestyle factors.","Table of Contents --

published,emory:phrdn,"Ko, Jasmine","John Keats and the Diagnostic Imagination: Questions of Suspended
Immortality and Sensual Immorality","Though other critical studies exist on the influences of
science and medicine on the works of John Keats, I propose that
these influences work specifically through the agency of Keats'
distinctly literary ""diagnostic imagination."" Keats was certainly
predisposed to science by his education as a medical professional,
but we must ultimately respect his decision to turn away from the
medical field and enter the literary world of poetry.
This thesis works to identify aspects of Keats' biography and
medical education that influenced his conception of life and
poetry, ultimately creating a term that I call Keats' diagnostic
imagination. By describing the framework of a diagnostic
imagination, I strive to incorporate Keats' medical and scientific
reasoning into an approach to interpretation that can be applied to
many of his works.
Specifically, this work will look at the idea of suspended
immortality and sensual immorality. Questions of immortality are
one aspect of cognitive dissonance that Keats explores with his
diagnostic imagination--his imagination sought to remedy the
concept of an inevitable death. Keats represents inevitable death
through scientific themes of meteorology, through which he depicts
the ""third physical state"" where one is in autumn and confronted
with the excess of the harvest amidst the looming of winter's
death. This state suspends life for a brief period of time, but is
a dream-like place devoid of senses. The questions of sensual
immorality, therefore, are an attempt to reach the satisfaction of
beauty and truth through exploring the intimate connections between
mental consciousness and physical bodily senses.
What is Keats' diagnostic imagination's ultimate diagnosis?
Cognitive functions such as the imagination must be intimately
experienced together with physical senses in order to carefully and
gradually unravel a true discernment of beauty and truth.","Introduction...1 -- --- -- Chapter 1- John Keats: A Brief

and geographic perspective","Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at
risk for lupus nephritis (LN), which can progress to end-stage
renal disease (ESRD). Adequate, timely identification and treatment
of LN and ESRD across sociodemographic groups and geographic areas
is essential for achieving equitable outcomes in the predominantly
young, minority U.S. SLE population.
First, ESRD incidence in SLE patients was estimated via linkage
of national ESRD surveillance data to a lupus registry including
345 incident Atlanta SLE patients (Aim 1). The overall ESRD
incidence rate among newly diagnosed SLE patients was 11.1 per 1000
patient-years, and 5.2% initiated ESRD treatment within 5 years.
Young age, black race, and early diagnosis of LN were associated
with 2-, 4-, and 7-fold higher ESRD incidence, respectively.
Next, associations of quality-of-ESRD-care indicators with
sociodemographics and U.S. region were explored among 6,594
incident LN-ESRD patients (Aim 2). Black vs. white patients
were less likely to receive pre-ESRD care (OR=0.73, 95% CI
0.63-0.85) and be waitlisted for a kidney transplant in the first
year of dialysis (HR=0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.81). Only 24% had a
permanent dialysis access, and those with no vs. private insurance
were 40% less likely to have a permanent access. Quality of ESRD
care varied 2- to 3-fold across U.S. regions, but patterns were not
consistent across indicators.
Finally, the association of duration of time to transplant with
risk of graft failure was examined in 4,743 incident kidney
transplant recipients with LN-ESRD (Aim 3). White LN-ESRD
patients transplanted later (vs. &lt;3 months on dialysis) were at
increased risk of graft failure [HR (95% CI): 3-12 months, 1.23
(0.93-1.63); 12-24 months, 1.37 (0.92-2.06); 24-36 months, 1.34
(0.92-1.97); and &gt;36 months, 1.98 (1.31-2.99)]. However, no such
association was seen among black recipients [3-12 months, 1.07
(0.79-1.45); 12-24 months, 1.01 (0.64-1.60); 24-36 months, 0.78
(0.51-1.18); and &gt;36 months, 0.74 (0.48-1.13)].
These results could be used to inform shared decision-making for
SLE patients and their providers. Additionally, these results
identify targets for interventions at the patient, provider, and
health system levels to improve care overall, as well as reduce
sociodemographic and geographic disparities in delivered care,
among SLE patients.","1. Introduction and Overview - 1 -- 1.1 Background - 1 -- 1.2 Study

Non-virus Factors: Observational Studies of Hospitalized Chinese
Patients","Objective: The aim of this study was
to examine the association between the changes in paired liver
biopsies and nutritional status, sleep status, alcohol consumption,
and antiviral therapy.

Methods: Data were collected from
the medical records of 190 hepatitis B patients in the 302 Military
Hospital, Beijing, China, who had two liver biopsies between
January 1999 and December 2012. Univariate analysis and
multivariate logistic analysis were conducted.

Results: 69 patients (36.3%) had
improvements in fibrosis stage and 73 (38.4%) had improvements in
inflammation grade. Drinking alcohol (OR=0.35, 95%CI 0.10-1.20,
p=0.09) was a harmful factor for the progression of fibrosis.
Nutritional status, sleep status, and antiviral therapy were not
statistically associated with the improvement in fibrosis stage. In
addition, good nutritional status (OR 3.15, 95%CI 1.43-6.96,
p&lt;0.01) and taking adefovir (OR 3.97, 95%CI 1.25-12.57, p=0.05)
were significantly associated with the improvement in inflammation
grade.

Conclusion: This study evaluated the
risk factors for the progression of liver damage and found that
alcohol consumption had a significant impact on the deterioration
of fibrosis. Nutritional status and antiviral therapy were
significantly associated with the improvement in inflammation
grade. No significant effect was associated with sleep status. The
association between the various therapeutic interventions and the
serological markers of virological clearance was not evaluated.
Without serological information, it is difficult to make any firm
conclusions. Further study will take into account whether treatment
resulted in the clearance of hepatitis B infection.","Table of Contents --

connectivity between the neurons of the MS and hippocampus, it is
necessary to be able to specifically target and activate/inhibit
each cell type separately. Optogenetics utilizes viral vectors to
specifically express light sensitive ion channels/pumps (LSICs) in
particular cell types in the central nervous system, providing
millisecond-precision activation or inhibition. Aim 1 of this
project is to investigate the specificity of the unique promoter
sequences CaMKIIα and hSynapsin as
well as the specificity of ChAT-CRE transgenic animals to neuron
phenotypes in the MS. Semi-quantitative cell counts can be used to
determine the phenotypical breakdown of hSyn-expressing neurons.
Aim 2 of this project is to quantify optogenetically activated
neurons using the presence of c-fos in the nucleus.
Stereotactic injections of AAV viral vectors were made in
the MS, followed by implantation of an optical ferrule targeting
the MS. Stimulation procedures utilized LED light.
ChAT-CRE-transgenic rats allowed for precise targeting of
cholinergic neurons for the expression of either the hChR2 or
eNpHR3.0 opsin. The unique promoter sequence
CaMKIIα allowed for exclusive
targeting of glutamatergic MS neurons for the expression of either
opsin. The promoter sequence hSynapin (hSyn) was observed to target
all three cell types. When quantified, cells expressing hSyn were
identified as GABAergic and glutamatergic significantly more often
than cholinergic. Misidentification of GABAergic and glutamatergic
MS cells is a concern due to the punctated appearance of both GAD
and VGLUT antibody stains; however, it may be that hSyn is
expressed in glutamatergic MS cells which project to GABAergic
cells within the MS as well.
C-fos was not observed within the stimulated region in any
animal but was observed in downstream structures and other regions.
This experiment remains inconclusive. Perfusion and fixation
quality and stimulation paradigm may have an effect on expression
and visualization of c-fos.","Introduction....................................................................................................................................

Program for Enhancing Pro-social Attitudes and Behaviors with
Elementary School Children","This study investigates the comparative efficacy of a
short-term, teacher-taught
compassion cultivation program known as
Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT)
versus Mindfulness Attention Training (MAT) and no
training for enhancing pro-social attitudes
and behaviors of elementary school students.
1st and 4th grade
classes were randomly assigned to
receive seven weeks of CBCT, MAT, or no training from
their trained teachers, with children
completing pre- and post-intervention measures of a
Story Stem task to measure pro-social
reasoning, a distributive justice task to measure
pro-social sharing, and the Olweus bullying
questionnaire to measure perceptions and frequency of
bullying. To supplement this data, a
school ethnography and teacher practice and
instruction logs were also conducted to gather a
qualitative assessment of how well the program was
implemented and how it could be improved
upon for future administration. Results showed that
for the Story Stem task, children in both the
1st and 4th grade CBCT classes had significantly greater
improvements in pro-social reasoning
than both the MAT and no training classes. No other
significant effects of intervention were
found for either the distributive justice or bullying
questionnaire measures. Considerable
limitations in the teacher training and the program
implementation were incurred invalidating a
critical assessment of this program. Corrections and
future directions are discussed.","-- Table of Contents --

STARTING IN THE KITCHEN : AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT
TEACHES CHILD CARE CENTER COOKS AND ADMINISTRATORS ABOUT HEALTHY
MENU PLANNING AND FOOD PERPARATION FOR CHILDREN","ABSTRACT
Obesity is a serious health concern for children and adolescents
(D.C. Hunger Solutions, 2010). Results from the 2007-2008
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), using
measured heights and weights, indicate that an estimated 17 percent
of children and adolescents ages 2-19 years are obese
(NHANES, 2010). Among pre-school age children 2-5
years of age, obesity increased from 5 to 10.4%, between the years
of 1976-1980, and from 6.5 to 19.6% between 2007-2008
(NHANES, 2010). In order to combat childhood obesity,
it is imperative that support comes from individuals who have the
ability to make a significant impact in a child's life when
parents, family, and friends are not able to do so. It is often
child care centers that are left with the responsibility of caring,
nurturing, educating and providing balanced meals for children
during their most critical years of life. A program committed to
educating cooks and administrators about healthy menu planning is
Healthy Futures Starting in Kitchen (HFSK). This
program targets those who serve children in child care
centers - cooks and administrators. HFSK offers healthy food
alternatives, ideas, and choices to the child care center (CCC)
menus. Five variables of interest include: whole grains,
milk, vegetables, low fat meats and proteins. The goal is to
evaluate pre- and post-menus to determine if changes have been made
after the HFSK program intervention according to the variables
selected. The content of this paper will discuss the importance of
the HFSK program and its effects on healthy menu planning in CCCs
in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. Assessing this
information will provide specific information which will help
improve program practices with the goal of expanding to other
North Carolina counties in the future.","-- TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Table of

BLA in Control and Chronically Stressed Rats","The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is the site
of fear-learning, and is part of the neural circuitry disrupted in
mood and affective disorders. Evidence suggests that
phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, which enhance cAMP levels,
could be potential treatments for affective disorders. In line with
this, unpublished data from our laboratory reveals that PDE4
inhibition causes robust changes in the physiological properties of
BLA principal neurons. Thus, aberrant PDE4 activity in BLA
principal neurons may contribute to the development of affective
disorders. There are approximately twenty-five known PDE4 isoforms,
and little is presently known about the baseline expression of PDE4
mRNA and protein isoforms in the BLA. We performed RT-PCR, single
cell RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical
analysis to elucidate the expression of PDE4 in the BLA. Our
results indicate that of the PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D mRNA
transcripts we investigated, all PDE4 isoforms were expressed in
the whole tissue BLA samples except PDE4D1 and PDE4D2. Moreover, we
found that mRNA transcripts for most of these PDE4 isoforms were
also expressed in BLA principal neurons, with the exception of
PDE4B1, PDE4B2, and PDE4D8. Western blot and immunohistochemical
analysis confirmed the presence of mature peptide for many of these
same isoforms. Following exposure to a repeated, four day,
unpredictable shock stress paradigm (USS), we found that PDE4A and
PDE4D mRNA transcripts were down-regulated in whole tissue samples
of the BLA. Importantly, PDE4D mRNA transcripts were also
down-regulated in BLA principal neurons following USS. A
semi-quantitative densitometric PCR analysis in whole tissue BLA
samples revealed that PDE4A1, PDE4A5, PDE4A8, PDE4A10, PDEB3,
PDE4B, PDE4D5, PDE4D7, PDE4D8, and PDE4D9 were significantly
down-regulated following USS. These PDE4 isoforms may represent
important targets for further investigation with quantitative PCR
probes and isoforms specific antibodies. Overall, this project has
taken the first steps in determining baseline expression of PDE4
isoforms in the BLA, an important task if PDE4 inhibitors are to be
used as pharmacological treatments for mood disorders in the
future.","Table of Contents --

Social Cognition and Object Relations in Adolescents: Associations
with Adaptive Functioning and
Personality Pathology
By Melissa Goldberg
The Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS) is a
measure applied to relational narrative
data to assess information about an individual's self/other
representations and interpersonal
functioning. While an abundance of research has used the SCORS to
assess adult psychopathology and
treatment response, less work has focused on adolescents. This
study aims to evaluate the
developmental stability of social cognition and object relations
across early and late-stage adolescents in
a clinical sample, its relationship to personality pathology and
adaptive functioning, and whether this
construct and measure provide incremental validity over personality
disorder diagnosis and age in
predicting multiple domains of adaptive functioning. SCORS scales
exhibited developmental growth
across age groups, showed significantly more pathology in
adolescents with diagnosable personality
pathology, and predicted domains of adaptive functioning above and
beyond age and DSM-IV
personality disorder diagnosis. These findings suggest that social
cognition and object relations
constitute aspects of personality crucial to adaptive functioning
that are related to but not fully captured
by personality disorder diagnosis.","Table of Contents --

published,emory:cqwx7,"Vandenberg, Ann Elisabeth","What We Can Say about Cognition in Aging: Arguments for and against
Cognitive Health Promotion","Rising life expectancies and reductions in chronic
disease mortality have resulted in an increasing prevalence of
cognitive impairment in the United States, with high societal and
personal costs, widespread fear, and a thriving marketplace of
cognitive solutions that have not received official sanction.
Cognitive health in aging has therefore emerged as a pressing
public health issue. However, the intersection of gerontology,
cognition, and public health has received little academic attention
to date. This qualitative research project examines the question,
Why have no public health recommendations been issued nationally
for older Americans to maintain or promote their cognitive
health? and the deeper epistemological question, What is
adequate evidence for issuing public health recommendations? or
When do we know enough to act? Using a grounded theory
framework, it examines discourse by cognitive health experts and
published documents in three areas of cognitive health activity:
research, industry, and policy. Altogether, 17 experts were
interviewed and a sequence of policy arguments traced from the
Cognitive and Emotional Health Project, to the Alzheimer's
Association's Maintain Your BrainTM campaign, to the
CDC-based Healthy Brain Initiative, to the NIH State-of-the-Science
Conference on Preventing Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline,
to the National Alzheimer's Project Act. After evaluating
epidemiology and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on lifestyle
behaviors for cognitive health, it examines arguments made for or
against issuing public health recommendations, using the Toulmin
model of analyzing arguments. The analysis revealed four
epistemological arguments for or against recommending public health
recommendations for cognitive health: 1) the Evidence-Based
Policy Argument, which uses RCTs alone to warrant issuing
recommendations, 2) the Epidemiologically Informed Policy
Argument, which proposes that epidemiology and RCTs together
constitute adequate evidence, 3) the Triangulated Evidence
Policy Argument, built around a cumulative weight of multiple
forms of evidence to support recommendations, and 4) the
Logically Derived Policy Argument, which uses RCTs showing
that a behavior is effective in preventing a risk factor for a
certain disease to endorse the same behavior to prevent a common
cognitive sequela of that disease. This project ultimately endorses
the Logically Derived Policy Argument in support of
heart-healthy behaviors for cognitive health.","--

gene therapy for hemophilia A","Pharmacologic evaluation of fVIII expression in retroviral
mediated gene therapy
for hemophilia A

By Kerry Titus Dooriss

Hemophilia A is an excellent candidate for gene therapy because it
can be cured
by the transfer of a single gene into any cell with access to the
bloodstream.
Unfortunately, the success of gene therapy has been hampered by low
and
transient transgene expression, the risk of insertional
mutagenesis, and the
frequent induction of an immune response. We hypothesized that
the
development of a safer viral vector incorporating a high-expressing
fVIII
transgene for the transduction and transplantation of hematopoietic
stem cells
can overcome the barriers of low and transient expression with a
decreased risk
of insertional mutagenesis. With respect to the development of a
high-expressing
transgene, a number of human, porcine, and human/porcine chimeric
transgenes
were developed for the purpose of determining which transgene
exhibits the
highest fVIII expression following lentiviral-mediated
hematopoietic stem cell
transduction and transplantation in a mouse model of hemophilia A.
We
discovered that porcine fVIII and one chimeric fVIII transgene
express at
significantly higher levels than any of the human constructs. We
also
demonstrated sustained fVIII expression in hemophilic mice
following lentiviral-
mediated transduction and transplantation of gene-modified
hematopoietic stem
cells. To evaluate the ability of a lentivirus to mediate
lineage-specific fVIII
expression in gene-modified bone marrow cells, self-inactivating
lentiviral vectors
were developed to express porcine fVIII under the control of the
Î²-globin
promoter and locus control region. We demonstrated high-level fVIII
expression
following lentiviral mediated gene-transfer into a myelogenous
leukemic cell line,
as well as from gene-modified hematopoietic cells in transplanted
mice. Although
we confirmed this lentiviral-mediated gene transfer platform is
capable of GFP
and fVIII expression in mice, hematopoietic stem cell transduction
efficiency was
limiting. Transduction efficiency was lower with the porcine
fVIII-containing
lentivirus compared to the GFP-containing lentivirus. Together,
these studies
demonstrate that a porcine or human/porcine chimeric transgene is
able to
mediate high level fVIII expression, that erythroid-specific fVIII
expression is
possible, and that hematopoietic stem cell transduction is the
limiting factor in the

Proliferation, and Differentiation in the Normal-Appearing Colonic
Mucosa of Patients at High Risk for Colorectal Cancer: Results from
a Pilot, Randomized, Controlled Trial","Background: To estimate the effects of ginger on apoptosis,
proliferation, and
differentiation in the normal human colorectal mucosa, we measured
the expression of cell
cycle markers in the normal-appearing colon mucosa of patients at
increased for CRC in a
pilot, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical
trial.
Methods: A total of 20 patients were treated with either 2.0 g
(eight 250 mg capsules) of
encapsulated ginger (standardized to 5%-gingerols) or placebo daily
for 28 days. Overall
expression and distributions of Bax, Bcl-2, p21, hTERT and MIB-1 in
colorectal crypts in
biopsies of normal-appearing colon mucosa were detected and
measured using automated
immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis. Percent
changes in biomarker
expression over the treatment period were calculated, categorized,
assigned a score and then
summed to construct a ""cell-cycle score.""
Results: Image analysis measurement intra-rater reliability was
â‰¥ 0.90 for all biomarkers. In
the ginger group relative to the placebo group, Bax expression
decreased 15.6% (p = 0.81)
along the full length of the crypts, 6.6% (p = 0.38) in the upper
40% (differentiation zone) of
the crypts, and 21.7% (p = 0.77) in the lower 60% (proliferative
zone) of the crypts;
however, there was a 19% increase (p = 0.80) in the proportion of
the expression of Bax in
the upper 40% relative to the whole crypt. While p21 and Bcl-2
expression remained
relatively unchanged, hTERT expression along the full length of
crypts decreased by 41.2%
(p = 0.05); the estimated treatment effect on hTERT expression was
slightly more
pronounced in the canonical differentiation zone of crypts (-47.9%;
p = 0.04). In the ginger
group relative to the placebo group, MIB-1 expression decreased
along the entire crypt,
upper 40% of crypts, and lower 60% of crypts by 16.9% (p = 0.39),
46.8% (p = 0.39), and
15.3% (p = 0.41), respectively.
Conclusions: These preliminary results 1) suggest that ginger may
reduce proliferation in the
normal-appearing colorectal epithelium and increase apoptosis and
differentiation relative to
proliferation-especially in the proliferative zone of the crypts,
and 2) support a full-scale
clinical trial to further investigate these results.","Table of Contents -- BACKGROUND

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE UTILIZATION PATTERNS IN PATIENTS
ADMITTED TO THE FOCUS INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM
AT GRADY HEALTH SYSTEM
BY
Karen Michele Hochman

Objective: This study examines mental health service use in
a cohort of severely
mentally ill patients admitted to an acute partial hospitalization
program (""FOCUS"")
between November, 2004 and December, 2007. Service use in the
twelve months before
and after admission was examined. Service use data were then
compared for program
completers and non-completers.
Methods: The FOCUS intervention was designed for adults
aged 18-64 who are
suffering from one or more Axis I disorders accompanied by severe
impairment.
Treatment included: psychiatric assessment, nursing/medical
screening,
pharmacotherapy, group, family and individual therapies, and case
management.
Programming was for five hours/day, five days a week. Data for 215
admissions were
examined for one year before and after admission to the program.
T-tests were used to
compare service use before and after the intervention, and between
completers and non-
completers.
Results: The mean duration of treatment was 52 days for
program completers and 26
days for non-completers. There was a significant decline in
inpatient days before and
after the intervention (19.0 days vs. 5.1 days, p&lt;0.001), with
no significant change in
Psych ER visits (1.6 visits vs. 1.5 visits, p=0.454). There were
three times more non-
urgent mental health visits (not including FOCUS visits) in the
twelve months after
admission to the program than before (3.9 vs. 11.7, p&lt;0.001);
furthermore, completers
attended three times as many non-urgent outpatient visits (not
including FOCUS visits)
as non-completers (14.4 vs. 5.1, p&lt;0.001).
Conclusions: The intervention was associated with a
decrease in inpatient days but not
ER visits. Results are limited by the pre-post study design and our
inability to control for
potential unmeasured confounders. Further research is needed in
order to determine
whether acute partial hospitalization in a population with high
disease burden and other
determinants of disproportionately low mental health service use
might improve
outcomes and enhance adaptive service use.","7 -- TABLE OF CONTENTS -- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Courts of Appeals","Abstract
The Influence of Business Groups as Amici on Judges in the U.S.
Courts of Appeals
Much has been written about the influence of business interest
groups on U.S. federal
government policy making. While most of the existing literature
focuses on administrative rule
making and legislative policy, this thesis explores the
effectiveness of business interests in
lobbying the federal judiciary. Thus, this study measures the
impact that business groups have
when participating as amici, friends of the court, before the U.S.
Courts of Appeals. I used
existing data about federal appellate cases collected from
1997-2002 and added new information
about the different interest groups which participated, including
their average expenditures on
lobbying during that time period. I find that business groups,
particularly well-resourced ones,
tend to account for most of the impact that amicus briefs have on a
judge's vote. This effect is
much clearer when businesses file for appellants than when they
support respondents. Aside
from federal agencies, other groups have little success when filing
amicus briefs. However, my
thesis finds that organizations which specialize in legal advocacy
do appear to help appellants
when they submit amicus briefs. My thesis raises questions about
whether the federal courts
provide a level playing field for all participants in litigation or
whether certain groups are
advantaged due to their expertise and resources.","Table of Contents -- Table of Contents -- I.

Among Palliative Care Patients From the Impact of Hospital-Based
Chaplain Support on Decision-Making During Serious Illness in a

palliative care study recruitment, and then use data from the
Impact of Hospital-Based Chaplain Support on Decision-Making During
Serious Illness in a Diverse Urban Palliative Care Population
(PCCS) study to investigate whether friend and family presence is
associated with palliative care study consent.
There were 325 patients who consented or
declined to consent to a second part of the PCCS study and were
included in this analysis. The patients included in the study had
an average of 1.3 diaries per patient before consent decision (423
diaries in total). The exposure of interest was presence of family
and friends during chaplain encounters, and was analyzed two ways:
as â€˜ever' or â€˜never,' and as
percentage of encounters where family or friends were present. The
exposure variable in the model with the binary
â€˜ever' or â€˜never' coding for
family or friend presence was not significant. The model analyzing
the proportion of encounters where family or friends were present
found a significant 40% decrease in the likelihood of consent for
patients who had family and friends present at all PCCS diary
encounters compared to patients with family and friends present at
none of the PCCS diary encounters. The results indicate that family
and friend presence is associated with palliative care study
recruitment.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

level, while illiteracy rates and realized FDI correlate
positively. Although the last three findings are not intuitively

MONOCYTE ACTIVATION AND DIFFERENTIATION AND DURING ACUTE STRESS IN
PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION","Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and release of
catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (NE), regulate inflammation
through interactions with the innate immune system. Although
crosstalk between these two systems is clear, the role of NE in
mediating inflammatory responses is less clear, with evidence of
both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. To further understand
these paradoxical effects of NE, we examined the impact of cellular
activation and differentiation on inflammatory cytokine production
after NE administration to a human monocyte cell line. Using
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cellular activation, we showed
that NE inhibits interleukin (IL)-6 protein release from the
monocytic form of the cell, when administered before LPS. However,
treating the cells with NE after LPS-induced activation led to a
decrease in NE's inhibitory effects. NE inhibition of LPS-induced
IL-6 was shown to be mediated by the beta 2-adrenergic receptor
(B2-AR) as well as cAMP. Interestingly, the decreased sensitivity
to NE following monocyte activation by LPS was found to be mediated
by a PKA-dependent decrease in B2-AR mRNA. Indeed, blocking PKA
reversed B2-AR mRNA downregulation and restored cell sensitivity to
NE. Differentiation of cells from the monocyte state to the
macrophage state also resulted in decreased NE sensitivity, likely
a result of increased mRNA expression of beta arrestin-2 (BARR-2),
which can lead to B2-AR desensitization. Finally, LPS-induced
activation of cells in the macrophage state completely abolished
NE's anti-inflammatory effects, in association with both decreased
B2-AR mRNA as well as decreased mRNA for BARR-2, which can inhibit
inflammatory responses. To study the impact of NE on inflammation
in vivo, we examined stress-induced NE and IL-6 release in patients
with major depression versus healthy controls. We found that
patients with depression exhibited reduced sensitivity to NE, as
depressed patients with high NE responses to stress exhibited the
highest stress-induced IL-6 responses. Taken together, these
studies indicate that NE primarily functions to inhibit
inflammation. However, the extent of NE's anti-inflammatory action
is dynamic and depends on the physiological state of the cell.
Dysregulation of NE's anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to
pathology in diseases involving inflammation, such as
depression.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Page -- Chapter One - Introduction: Interplay

Bonds Formation under Neutral pH Conditions
By
Zhihui Zhang

The transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling of thioorganics
with boronic acids or organostannanes under neutral conditions for
the construction of C-C bond has found various applications in
modern organic synthesis. As an extension of this strategy, a novel
cyanide-free cyanation reaction through the palladium(0)-catalyzed, copper(I)-mediated coupling of
boronic acids with thiocyanates was
developed. This non-basic desulfitative process provides a useful
complement to the traditional synthesis of nitriles through
metal-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl halides with cyanide
sources.
Based on the extensive study on previous thioorganic-boronic
acid cross-couplings, a mechanistically unprecedented desulfitative
protocol was developed which was completely catalytic in copper or
palladium. A general ketone synthesis through the
copper(I)-catalyzed cross-coupling of thiol esters with
organoborons or organostannanes was reported. The application of
this mechanism to the palladium-catalyzed desulfitative reaction of
more thioorganic substrates was proven promising. Present results

In addition to the selective functionalization of C-S bonds, a
novel N-O bond cleavage to give C-N bond products was investigated.
Under non-basic and non-oxidative conditions, O-acetyl
hydroxamic acids couple efficiently with a variety of
organostannanes or boronic acids in the presence of copper(I) sources to generate N-substituted amides

Racial/Ethnic Groups from 2004 to 2007 in the United States","Distribution of Serum Tumor Markers for Testicular Cancer across
Racial/Ethnic Groups from 2004 to 2007 in the United States
By Tiffany Hosten
Objective: While the incidence of testicular
cancer is lower among Non-Hispanic Black men
compared to U.S. men of other races and ethnicities, Black
testicular cancer patients have poorer
survival. Social factors may account for this observed disparity in
outcome, however, biological
tumor characteristics including levels of prognostic testicular
tumor markers such as alpha
fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) have
not previously been compared across racial and ethnic groups on a
population level.Methods: Using the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) public-access
dataset
from 2004 through 2007, the distributions of tumor markers for
testicular cancer cases were
compared in three groups of patients: Non-Hispanic Whites,
Non-Hispanic Blacks, and
Hispanics. Association between elevated levels of each marker and
race/ethnicity was examined
using multivariate logistic regression models with results
expressed as adjusted odds ratios (ORs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: We
found that Hispanics were more likely than Non-Hispanic Whites to
have elevated
LDH with OR (95% CI) 1.5 (1.2-1.8), while the corresponding result
for Blacks in comparison to
Whites was 1.5 (1.0-2.5). No difference in frequency of elevated
serum tumor marker levels was
observed across race/ethnicity for AFP and
hCG.Conclusion: Racial/ethnic disparities in
testicular cancer survival are more likely to be explained
by the differences in early detection, access to care, care
utilization, and quality of care than by
the differences in biological tumor characteristics. Future studies
should explore tumor marker
distributions among additional racial groups and use SEER's new,
more uniformly coded site-
specific variables.","Background and Literature Review

Fascism in Italy, 1945-1960","Bridging themes of regime change, dictatorial legacies, and
memory in postwar Europe, this dissertation analyzes the transition
from Fascism to democracy in Italy. I examine the ways in which
prominent ex-Fascists, particularly Giuseppe Bottai, interacted
with individuals in various sectors of society and participated in
the debate over the memory of Fascism from 1945-1960. This analysis
reveals that, in the first fifteen years after Mussolini's defeat,
ex-Fascist elites and ""a-Fascist"" Italians - those who would not
have self-identified as either Fascists or anti-Fascists - shared
certain modes of thinking about the dictatorial past and democratic
present, a sort of common mentality born from the twenty-year
experience of Fascist rule. Moreover, Italians from various walks
of life appealed to or did favors for ex-Fascists in the postwar
period, despite the latters' distance from the locus of political
power. Thus many ex-Fascists survived the upheaval of war and the
transition to democracy with their networks of influence in the
bureaucracy, various professions, the Vatican, and some political
movements intact. Viewing the legacy of dictatorship in terms of
mentality and interpersonal relationships brings to the foreground
the ways in which regime change was lived out and negotiated on a
daily basis. This study suggests that the social and cultural
legacy of Fascism ran deep in late-1940s and 1950s Italy.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- 1.

various domains of child and adolescent health","Nearly one in five youth in the US is overweight. Regular
physical activity and
limited television viewing are important behaviors for health, but
few studies have related
physical activity and TV viewing to changes in health among
youth, or assessed the impact of
sports participation as a means of acquiring physical activity. In
this dissertation, relationships
between weight maintenance, weight gain, and weight loss and
changes in cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risk factors were assessed. Associations between moderate and
vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) and TV viewing (TV) and changes in body mass index (BMI),
percent body fat (PBF),
and CVD risk factors were also examined. Differences between sports
participants and non-
participants were described with regard to weight-related
perceptions, intentions, and practices;
correlates of weight-related intentions and weight-control
practices in sports participants were
assessed.
MVPA was not associated with changes in BMI, PBF, blood pressure or
blood lipids;
TV was positively related to increases in BMI and PBF. Estimates of
MVPA and TV did
not vary among BMI maintainers, losers, and gainers, but greater
increases in the sum of CVD
risk factors and larger declines in HDL were observed among
gainers, relative to maintainers.
Independent of changes in BMI, TV was positively associated with
increases in LDL.
Sports participants were more likely to meet MVPA and TV guidelines
than non-
participants. Disordered weight-control practices did not differ
between sports participants and
non-participants, but intention to gain weight was more common
among male sports participants
than non-participants. Receiving weight-related advice from a peer
or adult was associated with
increased odds of weight-gaining intention and using dietary
supplements among male sports
participants. In females, weight-loss and weight-maintenance
intentions were influenced by
receiving advice from a peer and adult. Perceived weight influenced
intentions more than
measured BMI in this subgroup.
These findings suggest that limiting TV to prevent excess increases
in BMI and adiposity
could have implications for reducing undesirable changes in CVD
risk measures during youth.
Participation in sports may be a viable mechanism to limit TV as
well as provide a platform for
the discussion of healthy weight-related perceptions, intentions,
and practices.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

IMMUNOGENICITY BY ALTERNATIVE ROUTES OF IMMUNIZATION
By William C. Weldon
Structural studies of recombinant sHA indicate that the oligomeric
status varies with HA
subtype and immunogenicity is associated with trimeric proteins. To
stabilize the
oligomeric structure, we modified the C-terminus of the sHA derived
from the H3N2
influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68 was modified with the GCN4pII
trimerization repeat. This
modification was found to stabilize the H3 sHA trimers while
unmodified H3 sHA was a
mixture of trimers, dimers and monomers. Conformation-specific
monoclonal antibodies
indicate that the trimeric sHA presented native epitopes while the
unmodified sHA
presented low-pH conformation epitopes. In vaccination studies, we
observed enhanced
immune responses with the stabilized trimeric sHA resulting in 100%
protection against
lethal challenge. Our results suggest that stabilization of
trimeric H3 sHA enhances
immunogenicity and confers protective immune responses by
preserving epitopes present
in the native trimeric structure of HA.
We also investigated the efficacy of skin-based vaccination using
microneedles coated
with recombinant H3 sHA. Our data indicate that the modified
trimeric sHA induces
improved immune responses resulting in 100% protection against
lethal challenge, and
improved clearance of influenza virus from lungs of vaccinated mice
after lethal
challenge compared to subcutaneous vaccination. Coated-microneedle
vaccination with
the trimeric sHA induced increased serum and mucosal IgA compared
to the unmodified
sHA. In addition, we observed an increased Th1 helper T cell
phenotype following
microneedle vaccination with trimeric sHA. Our results demonstrate
the efficacy of skin-
based vaccination with a recombinant HA subunit vaccine.
We extended our studies of stabilized H3 sHA trimers to investigate
the effect of trimer
stabilization of the H1 sHA derived from the swine-origin influenza
virus
A/California/04/2009. Modification of the H1 sHA with GCN4pII
generated stabilized
trimers while unmodified sHA formed monomers. However, vaccination
studies indicate
that the trimeric sHA was less immunogenic than the monomeric sHA,
with neither
recombinant H1 sHA conferring complete protection from lethal
challenge. These data
indicate that a different strategy for antigen design is required
for the H1 sHA","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- ABSTRACT -- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- LIST OF TABLES

The Impact of Informal Caregiving on Physical and Mental
Health
By Heather Dawn Coffin
Informal caregivers provide essential long-term care that allows
aging and disabled
individuals to safely remain in their community; however, previous
studies have found that
informal caregiving has health consequences for the caregiver. A
growing need for informal
caregivers is being driven by increased longevity and a desire for
non-institutionalized care.
A stronger understanding of caregiving consequences at a national
level is needed to inform
caregiver support policies. We examined the physical and mental
health burden of informal
caregiving in a recent population-based US sample. We analyzed the
2009 Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System data from DC, Illinois, Louisiana, and
North Carolina
(n=31,715). Using logistic regression, we examined the likelihood
of being obese, having
high blood pressure, and having poor mental health days,
conditional on caregiver status and
controlling for demographics, socioeconomic status, health
behaviors, healthcare access, and
emotional support. We then studied how the medical condition of the
care recipient impacts
caregiver health. We found caregivers had higher odds of being
obese and of having poor
mental health days than non-caregivers. Among caregivers,
caregiving burden and caregiving
activity were found to negatively influence mental health. In
conclusion, informal caregivers
are a population at risk for obesity and diminished mental health.
Increased support services
may be needed to help caregivers offset these health risks. The
observed physical health
impact of caregiving suggests that interventions should reach
beyond mental health support,
to also include physical health evaluation and education.

Adiposity and Breast Cancer: The Role of Genetic and Modifiable
Risk Factors
By Lauren R. Teras
Obesity has been consistently associated with an increased risk of
postmenopausal
breast cancer. However, the implications of this association for
cancer prevention and the
genetic contributions to mechanisms by which obesity may affect
breast cancer risk are
not fully understood. The goal of this dissertation was to address
three unanswered
questions: 1) Does weight loss reduce breast cancer risk in
overweight women? 2) Do
polymorphisms of genes that encode adipokines contribute to risk of
postmenopausal
breast cancer? 3) Do genetic and non-genetic factors that impact
estrogen level interact to
affect risk for breast cancer?
Study 1 found that weight loss was not associated with
postmenopausal breast
cancer risk; however understanding the potential benefit of weight
loss is challenged by
the rarity, timing, and sustainability of weight loss. Study 2 was
a comprehensive
examination of the known variability in five genes that code for
the two most abundantly
produced adipokines (leptin and adiponectin). This second study did
not identify any
associations with postmenopausal breast cancer. Finally, Study 3
found no evidence of
gene-gene or gene-environment joint effects between
estrogen-related factors using two
analytic methods: multifactor dimensionality reduction and logic
regression. Other
methods that incorporate all known biological information may be
needed to model more
complex relationships between the genes and the
environment.

Effect of a joint incident management team response on health
care providers'
perceptions regarding the adequacy of pandemic H1N1 vaccination
campaigns in
Washington, USA, 2009
By
Grishma Kharod

In light of the H1N1 influenza spread, health care providers and
departments
implemented emergency preparedness and response plans and set up
systems to
efficiently allocate vaccines for prevention. Region 4 counties in
the state of
Washington executed a joint incident management team (IMT) system
to respond to
the pandemic. The objective of this study was to study the extent
to which use of a
joint IMT system affected health care providers' perceptions on the
adequacy of the
H1N1 pandemic vaccination campaigns. Health care providers (n=619)
from the
state of Washington who applied for H1N1 vaccine in 2009 from the
state
department of health were surveyed to determine their H1N1 pandemic
response
behaviors and perceptions. Zip codes and phone calls to regional
lead health
departments were used to determine which counties utilized the
joint IMT systems.
Logistic regression models were employed to assess associations
between IMT use
and health care providers' perceptions on vaccination campaign
adequacy.
Participants in a joint IMT system for H1N1 response were less
likely to find
information received from local health departments to be useful
than practices that
did not participate in joint IMT systems. Additionally, joint IMT
participants were
less likely than non-participants to be concerned about denying
vaccine to low-
priority groups. Results suggested better management of vaccination
supplies and
more effective management of vaccination campaigns with centralized
responses,
such as the IMT systems. The associations between joint IMT use and
health care
providers' perceptions of H1N1 vaccination campaign adequacy were
adjusted for
type of practice, number of physicians and pharmacists in practice,
and staff
participation in preparedness training drills and sessions. The
findings from this
study served as preliminary steps toward validating the
effectiveness of joint IMT
use, and can be used to implement centralized responses in more
regions.","Table of contents -- Chapter 1: Background and literature review

Background: Identifying and addressing nutrition issues
among US-resettling refugee children are a human rights issue.
Methods: The target population is children from Burma,
Bhutan, Somalia, Liberia, Eritrea, Sudan, Burundi, and the
Democratic Republic of Congo 6-59 months of age who live in
secondary country camps prior to US-resettlement. Analysis of camp
child nutrition data informs pre-arrival nutrition conditions. A
survey of Refugee Health Coordinators provides information on
nutritional assessment, reporting and referrals in domestic refugee
medical screening. Results: Half of the camps had global
acute malnutrition prevalence rates over 15% at least once from
2004-2010. Camps collecting anemia data had greater than 40%
prevalence. The majority of State-regulated refugee health exams
include height and weight measurements but few use National Center
for Health Statistics or WHO standards. Recommendations:
Improve overseas monitoring and data linkages of nutrition
information to US-resettlement services. Domestically, adopt
standards for nutrition assessment and referral protocols.

Riboswitches","As an emerging class of genetic regulatory elements,
synthetic riboswitch has become a handy tool that allows
conditional regulation of gene expression and facilitates the
downstream application with great versatility. Previous efforts
have successfully expanded the repertoire of synthetic
riboswitches; however, the knowledge of synthetic riboswitch
mechanism remains unclear. In this thesis, we present a detailed
molecular study to reveal mechanistic insights of our model
theophylline riboswitch. This study helps to construct the
first biophysical model of synthetic riboswitch that has predictive
power. Meanwhile, the kinetic aspect of riboswitch mechanism
is analyzed to support the hypothesis that riboswitch
function contains both thermodynamic and kinetic components.
Furthermore, we implement our biophysical model to design a
novel class of synthetic tetramethylrosamine riboswitches.
Detailed characterization of these riboswitches is provided
to illustrate their mechanism and guide further applications. Each
chapter reveals one aspect of riboswitch function and
advances our ability to create more efficient synthetic
riboswitches.","Chapter 1 - Introduction

Micronutrient biomarkers of Nutrition Status Influence the Risk of
TB in US Men
and Women: NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study

By Farah Srichandra

Background: One third of the world's population is thought
to be infected with
tuberculosis (TB), and new infections occur at a rate of about one
per second. The
proportion of people who become sick with TB each year is stable or
falling in different
regions of the world, but, because of population growth, the
absolute number of new
cases is still increasing. Undernutrition is an important risk
factor for TB, but, primarily,
studies have been conducted on anthropometric measures for
nutritional status and few
studies have used biomarkers for nutritional status.

Objective: This research analyzes the risk of developing TB
in relation to micronutrient
biomarkers of nutritional status. Our specific interest is whether
micronutrient biomarkers
of nutritional status at baseline are related to the incidence of
TB during the follow-up of
10 to 20 years.

Methods: In the NHANES-1 epidemiological follow-up study,a
nationally representative
data set of 14,407 adults who were followed up on 3 to 4 occasions
over a period of 10 to
20 years. Secondary data analysis was carried out using SAS
statistical software, to
examine the relationship between deficiencies in hemoglobin,
albumin, vitamins A,
iron and the incidence of TB. The primary dependent variable is
incidence of TB during the follow - up period.

Results: Anemia and low serum albumin are independent risk
factors for physician
diagnosed TB, and it's magnitude of effect is 3.02 (1.44, 6.34) 95%
CI.As a result, the chances of
developing TB increase by 3-fold for persons who are anemic.
Vitamin A was not associated with physician diagnosed TB.

Discussion: The longitudinal cohort study provides data on a
large national sample, it presents a unique opportunity for health
researchers to study changes in health status and the factors that
contribute to good health as well as illness. This study provides
implications to address the importance of micronutrient biomarkers
as a way to combat TB globally.","Table of Contents -- I. Introduction

often eschewed tax cuts because
they viewed them as leading to budget deficits. Beginning in the
1970s, a conservative vanguard
of economists worked to change the Republican's aversion to tax
cuts. These economists
advocated supply-side economics, an unconventional theory that
stated among many things that
if the government lowered tax rates, it would paradoxically raise
tax revenues as it would
stimulate the economy. The public face of this movement was Jack
Kemp, a young and rising
congressman from eastern New York. I will argue that Jack Kemp was
able to rebrand the
Republican Party by changing its economic ideology and through
courting unconventional
constituencies.","Introduction……………………………………………………………………..………………............1

Overutilization at Northeast Georgia Medical Center","Background: Emergency departments are currently
experiencing crowding, long wait times, and significant strain on
the staff, and are targeting over utilizers as a way to divert care
into more appropriate care settings. Northeast Georgia Hospital
System (NGHS) Emergency Department, the busiest in the state has
developed extensive community healthcare settings but continues to
have returning over utilizers which taxes their already limited
resources.
Method: This study used an existing emergency room survey
instrument modified to determine the perceived barriers to
utilizing community healthcare options. Emergency department
patient database was applied to identify the over utilizers,
reasons for visits and statistical patterns for emergency
department use.
Results: Of those surveyed the most common barriers were
associated with perceived cost of community care, and lack of
awareness of community options. Fifty-two percent cited appointment
barriers, inability to get an appointment which fit their schedule
or find an available appointment time in a timely manner.
Twenty-nine percent said that transportation was a problem. Other
barriers to community care include healthcare urgency perceptions
by the patient, medication compliance, health literacy, and
cultural norms.
Conclusion: Over utilizers perceived barriers to
community healthcare are similar to national trends. Even though
patients may have access to primary care, they often feel that
their community health care does not meet their health goals. On
the other hand, these patients feel the emergency department does
provide for their health needs with respect to relief, convenience,
cost, and resolution of acute exacerbations.","--  --

dopamine pathway is heavily involved in nearly all aspects of
financial decision-making. Its role has been defined by its
involvement in reward-related learning as it relates to monetary

loss-related learning. This dissertation was designed to advance
our understanding of this systems involvement in aversive and loss
related decision making. To do this, we use functional magnetic
resonance imaging while human participants engage in experimental
economic tasks that deal with financial decisions over gains and
losses. We show that, 1) during decision-making, the ventral
striatum tracks the expected values of gambles that are entirely
aversive, 2) heterogeneity in loss-holding behavior in the stock
market can be explained via activity within the ventral striatum,
and 3) the ventral striatal processes earnings announcements which
lead to financial loss, and are correlated with subsequent changes
in stock price. We find that the BOLD response in the ventral
striatum to loss outcomes in all three of our experiments fit with
the prediction error hypothesis of dopamine activity. Finally, we

Pedagogies as Critical Race Feminist Responses to the Childhood
Obesity Epidemic","Precious Opportunities: Black Girls Stories and
Resistance
Pedagogies as Critical Race Feminist Responses to the
Childhood Obesity Epidemic

Black girls have been featured throughout the ""real"" genre of
televisual media as
universal representatives of obese youth in America. Statistically,
they are the
youth population with the highest prevalence of obesity.
Precious Opportunities is attentive to the treatment
of black girls bodies within the ""childhood obesity""
visual narrative through a critical examination of commercial mass
media. This
dissertation is organized around four major areas: American
consumer culture,
feminist body theory, critical race theory, and resistance
pedagogy. Using a
critical race feminist framework, this project seeks to challenge
the framing of
""childhood obesity"" within popular media. It also challenges
neoliberal
recommendations that individual youth simply ""eat better"" and
""workout."" The
dissertation argues that the fiercening of capitalism and expansion
of media
conglomerates through acquisitions has significantly influenced
individual
decision-making and consumer choice. A multi-sited media
ethnography, it
begins with a content analysis of Too Fat for Fifteen: Fighting
Back, the first
televised reality series dedicated to ""childhood obesity,"" followed
by an
interrogation of corporate actions by primary parent companies
involved with the
series. Precious Opportunities advances humanities-based
responses to the
framing of childhood obesity in a ""pedagogy of mass consumption.""
The first
response explores the treatment of black girls' bodies within black
feminist
literature as an alternative to televisual media. Using Sapphire's
novel Push as a
counterstory, it analyzes ""childhood obesity"" from the perspective
of Precious
Jones, a fat black girl protagonist. The second response engages
youth directly in
an eight-week summer camp, Camp Carrot Seed. As a ""pedagogy for
social
change"" it offered a group of black teenagers opportunities to
develop multiple
literacies including: organic gardening, grocery shopping, cooking,
creative
expression, and environmental stewardship in exchange for studying
their
decision-making regarding food and physical activity.","Table of Contents -- Introduction -- The ""Childhood Obesity

novel indexes developed and used in the RealConsent study, a
web-based sexual violence
preventive intervention for male undergraduates implemented and
evaluated at Georgia State
University. These metrics assessed five important constructs
designed for use in evaluations of
sexual violence interventions: legal knowledge of informed consent,
perceptions of informed
consent, self-efficacy to intervene when a woman's consent is
compromised, outcome
expectancies for non-consensual sex, and outcome expectancies for
intervening behaviors. Each
scale was assessed for reliability and validity. Results showed
that one of the three novel scales:
Self-Efficacy to Intervene, and one of the two indexes: Perceptions
of Informed Consent for Sex,
showed adequate reliability and validity. These two metrics are
therefore verified for future
research efforts, while the other three may need further analysis
or modification to enhance their
utility in future studies.","Table of Contents -- Background

Activity Relationships of Novel GluN2C/D Subunit Selective
Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor","The N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ionotropic
glutamate receptors whose family members, identified by sequence
homology and pharmacology, comprise the
2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA),
kainate and delta receptors. The NMDA receptors respond to the
co-agonists glycine and glutamate and mediate the slow component of
excitatory neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system
(CNS). The functional NMDA receptor is a hetero-tetramer consisting
of two GluN1 subunits which bind to glycine and two GluN2 subunits
(GluN2A-D). Both the Glun1 subunits, which have eight different
splice variants, and the GluN2 subunits, which are encoded by four
distinct genes, can impart various unique functional and
pharmacological properties to the functional receptor, with the
GluN2 subunits having a greater impact on the various different
properties. While the receptors have been known and studied
intensely for several decades, until recently, subunit-selective
pharmacological tools remained elusive since the 1980s when the
first selective agent targeting GluN2B receptors was discovered and
characterized. This dissertation describes novel subunit-selective
allosteric modulators which target the GluN2C- and
GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors. The findings include the
identification of key structural determinants of activity for one
of the classes described, the identification of highly potent and
selective congeners within the same class, the stereochemical
preference of one of the more potent and selective members of the
small molecules, the beginning of the physicochemical property
optimization of the molecules and data and hypotheses suggesting
that distinct classes of molecules bind to a shared, or overlapping
site at the GluN2D containing receptors.","-- Chapter 1: Introduction --

Examination of Phasic and Sustained Fear Responses
Using a Novel Sustained Fear Conditioning Paradigm

By: Leigh Miles
Basic research has greatly improved our understanding of
the neural mechanisms underlying emotional disorders such as fear
and anxiety. Preclinical research has shown that while fear- and
anxiety- like responses share similar physiological symptoms, they
are mediated by different neural substrates. The medial division of
the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeAM) is necessary
for the expression of fear-like responses to short-duration,
predictable threats (operationally defined as phasic fear), and the
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is necessary for the
expression of anxiety-like responses to more long-duration, less
predictable threats (operationally defined as sustained
fear).
Experiments within this dissertation used fear-potentiated
startle procedures to further examine the neural mechanisms
mediating phasic and sustained fear responses in rats. Studies were
designed to measure within-subject phasic and sustained fear, to
pharmacologically dissociate fear responses using treatments that
either are or are not clinically effective
anxiolytics, and to evaluate if the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor fluoxetine mediates its effects through serotonin within
the BNST.
Rats received a single pre-test injection of the
benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), the 5-HT1A
partial agonist buspirone (5 mg/kg), the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), or chronic (21-day)
fluoxetine treatment and were tested for phasic and sustained fear.
The role of serotonin within the BNST in chronic fluoxetine
treatment was assessed in rats given chronic fluoxetine and then
tested for sustained fear 48 hrs after bilateral BNST infusions of
the serotonin lesioning agent,
5,7-dihydroxytryptamine
(2µg/side).
Acute chlordiazepoxide (clinically effective treatment)
blocked sustained but not phasic responses, acute buspirone (not
clinically effective) did not affect sustained, but did disrupt
phasic responses, chronic fluoxetine (clinically effective
treatment) blocked sustained responses and unreliably reduced
phasic responses, and acute fluoxetine (not clinically effective)
affected neither. The results provide further evidence that phasic
and sustained fear are mediated by different neural mechanisms and
suggest that sustained fear may have greater predictive validity as
a model of clinical anxiety as compared to phasic fear. Finally,
although not statistically significant, results suggest that
serotonin within the BNST may be important for the anxiolytic
effects of chronic fluoxetine in this model.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: General

Contemporary Campus Kiruv at
Emory: Departing from ""Outreach"" and ""Returning"" to Judaism
By Dara Gever
Emory's stimulating scholastic
undergraduate campus has become the launching pad for a new
approach to the Jewish concept of ""kiruv,"" a Hebrew word for
""reaching out"" to Jews who are ""far away."" In American university
contexts, the term ""kiruv"" has traditionally been used to
refer to the nationally-sanctioned Jewish satellite organizations
Hillel and Chabad. In addition to these campus ""outreach models,""
Jewish American college students at Emory are being courted by an
Orthodox organization offers paid classes and free trips to Israel.
This new organization, called ""Meor,"" is the ""elephant in the
room,"" a burgeoning force of Emory's Jewish community that is
becoming impossible to ignore and is important to understand. Since
coming to Emory hardly five years ago, Meor has expanded the scope
of its programming and its clientele at an enviable rate, compared
to that of Emory Hillel and Chabad. Parents, familiar with the
Hillel and Chabad paradigms, have little knowledge of Meor because
of its novelty. Emory's Jewish professors and lay leaders, as well
as the traditional ""Jewish outreach"" leaders, are scratching their
heads at the changing face of campus Jewish life. Students
themselves, even those who are most affected by the new campus
kiruv, are often puzzled by the plethora of irresistible
opportunities for participating in Jewish life. Using an
ethnographic approach, this thesis will examine the ways in which
Meor at Emory University departs from the conventional campus
kiruv models by analyzing the goals, programming and
rhetoric of Meor educators and the experiences of Meor student
participants. This account of Emory's transforming Jewish life, and
the candid perspectives of kiruv educators and Emory
students, is the first study that examines campus kiruv
through ethnographic perspectives.","--

published,emory:pg9d7,"Ralston, Joshua B.",Law and the Rule of God: A Christian-Muslim Exchange,"This dissertation develops a comparative political theology to
engage longstanding debates over the place and function of law in
Muslim-Christian relations. By adopting a comparative approach, I
avoid two routes that dominate most discussions of political
theology in Christian-Muslim exchange. One leans on the legal
apparatuses of secularism, and thus silences religious commitments
and their critiques of modernity; and the other attempts to
reassert the ultimacy of religious community over and against the
secular state largely through reinscribing old battle lines between
Christendom and the dar al-Islam. Instead, I argue that
debates regarding Shari'a, secularism, and law can be
productively reframed by attending to the history of debate over
the law in Christian-Muslim encounter and also the nuanced
perspectives regarding public law within the theo-legal discourse
of both Islam and Christianity. To advance this argument, I first
offer a critical evaluation of two Christian perspectives on
Shari'a, arguing that both misconstrue Shari'a as
inherently legalistic and politically theocratic. By dismissing
Shari'a, Christian thinkers fail to engage Islamic political
ethics and Muslim critiques of secularism and Christianity. The
third chapter addresses this lacuna by tracing shifts in Muslim
judgments of Christian views of law from their initial focus on
tahrif to modern arguments that connect the lack of a
Christian Shari'a to the rise of secularism. Ibn Taymiyya
proves to be pivotal, combining early rhetoric with a
legal-political criticism of Christian power. Chapters four and
five offer a constructive response to these challenges through a
reading of the relationship between divine and public law in Justin
Martyr, Aquinas, Luther, and Barth. Building on Barth's theology, I
contend that public law can be understood as a provisional and
indirect witness to the divine rule. I conclude by arguing that
this Christian position resonates with Islamic concerns regarding
the distinction between Shari'a and fiqh, and the
demand to examine legal rulings in light of the higher purposes of
the law. My comparative analysis of debates in post-colonial
Islamic Thought and Western Christian political theology presents
mutually enriching possibilities for understanding the limits of
the secular and the relationship between divine and public law.","--

published,emory:ph6rc,"Luffy, Samantha M.","Violence, unintended pregnancy, and the total ban on
abortion: a qualitative examination of threats to women's autonomy
in Ocotal, Nicaragua","Ocotal, a relatively isolated city in the North Central region
of Nicaragua, is characterized by severe poverty and limited
sources of sexual and reproductive (SRH) care. National data
suggest unintended pregnancies are more frequent in Ocotal compared
to other major cities. Existing research does not adequately
explain why unintended pregnancies are more common in this
region.
Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs)
were utilized to explore women's experiences with unintended
pregnancy as well as the context surrounding such experiences. From
May to August 2014, three FGDs and ten IDIs were conducted in
Spanish with young women ages 16-27 years old from various
neighborhoods in the city. FGDs were completed with groups of women
to elucidate community norms regarding the topics of interest:
access to SRH services, knowledge of sexual and reproductive
rights, and opinions of the total ban on abortion. The FGDs
informed subsequent IDIs, in which individual women shared their
personal experience with an unintended pregnancy.
Women identified numerous barriers to accessing SRH services,
such as: criticism by others, violence against women (VAW),
machismo, and lack of open communication with parents and partners.
Though participants had limited formal knowledge of sexual and
reproductive rights, they were able to provide examples of such
rights. Women believed their sexual and reproductive rights
originate from national laws, such as Law 779, which is meant to
eradicate VAW. Due to religious ideologies, most participants
agreed with the country's total ban on abortion, except in the case
of rape. Women also had extremely varied experiences with
unintended pregnancy due to: familial support, employment status,
relationship with the biological father, and other factors.
The findings of this study provide context for the high
prevalence of unintended pregnancy in Ocotal and describe the
complex interactions between multiple factors that the study
population believes are related to unintended pregnancy, including
Law 779 and the total ban on abortion. The findings of this study
serve as the foundation for future interdisciplinary research and
offers suggestions for potential interventions at the neighborhood,
city, and national levels to advance women's autonomy and improve
SRH outcomes in Ocotal, Nicaragua.","Table of Contents -- Table of Tables and Figures -- Acronym List --

the state-owned business
groups that unsuccessfully expand into unrelated business
activities but are allowed to dominate the
economy at the expense of the private sector. I argue that the
persistent dominance of business groups
in Vietnam stems from two main factors: political fragmentation and
natural resource abundance. These
two factors independently lead to the persistence of
diversification strategies that underscore
economies of scale rather than economies of scope. Moreover,
natural resources also act as an
intervening factor between political factions and unrelated
diversification. In other words, natural
resource abundance fuels fragmentation in the government which in
turn prompts firms to expand into
non-core markets. The study goes on to illustrate the theory by
examining the Vietnam Electricity
Corporation (EVN), one of the thirteen general corporations in
Vietnam in 2011.","Abstract 1 -- I. Introduction 1 -- II. The significance of the

POSSIBLE ROLE OF NEUROTROPHINS IN ENDOMETRIOSIS
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
By Aimee Schickedanz Browne, M.D.
Purpose: Small nerves have been identified in the functional
layer of eutopic
endometrium in women with endometriosis, but not in women
without
endometriosis. The pathophysiology of neuron growth remains
unknown, but
suggests a possible mechanism to explain the pain associated
with
endometriosis. Neurotrophins, like nerve growth factor (NGF),
regulate nerve
growth throughout the body and they contribute to many diseases.
The purpose
of this study was to evaluate the expression of NGF in the
endometrium of
women with endometriosis compared to controls.
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in NGF protein
levels between
endometriosis patients and controls.
Design: Cross sectional study.
Materials and Methods: We performed endometrial biopsies on
women of
reproductive age at the time of surgery. Biopsy specimens were
split and
preserved in RNA-later® or solubilized in protein lysis
buffer. Reverse
transcription-PCR with sequence-specific primers was performed to
detect NGF
mRNA transcripts in the human endometrial tissue. Next, we
determined if NGF
protein concentrations in the biopsy samples differed between
endometriosis
patients and controls. Western blots confirmed the presence of NGF
precursors
and mature protein isoforms and a quantitative ELISA was developed
to measure
NGF protein in biopsy homogenates.
Results: PCR analysis revealed the presence of NGF mRNA in
human
endometrial tissue. ELISA and Western blots confirmed the
expression of NGF
protein. A Mann Whitney test was used to compare the mean levels of
total NGF
protein in endometriosis patients and controls. No differences
between the
endometriosis patients and controls were noted (P=0.83).
Conclusions: NGF mRNA and protein are expressed in eutopic
endometrial
tissues derived from patients with endometriosis as well as normal
controls. The
protein concentrations did not differ significantly between the two
groups. The
findings indicate that the presence of endometrial nerves in
endometriosis cases
cannot be attributed solely to differential NGF protein expression.
Hence,
measurement of endometrial NGF cannot be used as a diagnostic test
for
endometriosis.","Table of Contents -- Introduction

examine the relationship between the freedom inherent in being a
subject and the structure of habit, as the implicit passing forth
of one's identity. The work questions whether habits signify
permanent constraints upon a subject's inherent freedom. This
thesis is organized into four chapters. The first chapter focuses
upon the radical differences in being exhibited by a subject and an
object. The second chapter examines the phenomenon of bad faith as
a position a subject may take towards his or her being, in the form
of an evasion. The third chapter focuses upon the subject's first
experience of his or her being, as well as how this experience may
act as dispositional towards the adoption of bad faith. The fourth
and final section gives an account of the subject as an embodied
conscious and considers the relation between habit and

published,emory:7tjjr,"Madani, Ali John","From Time to Eternity: Augustine, Milton, and the Problem of
Reconciling the Eternal with the Temporal","Spoken in a prayer to his God, Augustine opens his philosophical
discussion in
the Confessions with a question into the nature of time and
its role as a barrier to
fully encountering the divine. Augustine, not alone in his
question, echoes a
perennial frustration with the relationship between things eternal
and things
temporal. This work attempts to address the seemingly
irreconcilable separation
through an analysis of Book XI of Augustine's major work in the
context of early
Christianity and with the backdrop of Ancient Greek and
Neo-Platonist thought.
Having bridged the gap between time and eternity through the use of
the eternal
Word, this project extends its scope to investigate Augustinian
philosophy's
influence on John Milton, specifically the poetry prior to
Paradise Lost. The
early work of Sonnet 16, On Time, and On the
Morning of Christ's Nativity
provide a frame by which to understand the centrality of time's
operations and
its importance for the faithful seeking God. Finally, a focus on
the static postures
that pervade Milton's poetry demonstrates the debt he owes to
Augustine and
the vision he imagines for a future in which time and eternity are
one.","Table of Contents -- Introduction

Athletes","Objective
The study aimed to investigate the effect of five air
pollutants-ozone, PM2.5, black carbon, particles, and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon, on oxidative stress of high school athletes
before and after physical activity and training.
Methods
125 high school athletes from two high schools in Atlanta
metropolitan area were included, and exhale breath condensate
samples were collected before and after physical activity. Air
pollutants concentrations were measured on site or collected from
ground monitoring database during the training. The percentage
concentration of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in the glutathione
(GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) pair in the breath condensate
samples before and after training was measured using HPLC. Linear
mixed model is used to assess the association between air pollutant
exposure and changes in glutathione biomarker.
Results
In the linear mixed model, ozone exposure is significantly
associated with the difference in percentage change of GSSG
(P-value = 0.023). Four other pollutants did not significantly
affect the percentage change of GSSG (P-value &gt; 0.05). Age was
also identified as a factor associated with GSSG level.
Conclusion
Ozone exposure has a significant effect on oxidative
stress during physical activity. Lowering the pollutant exposure,
such as conduct indoor exercise instead of outdoor exercise, would
help protect young athletes from ozone.","Introduction 1 -- Methods 2 -- Study design 2 -- Ambient and indoor

approved,emory:pj6rf,"Branch, Mary Rose",Shedding light on the spatiotemporal regulation of RGS14,"RGS14 is a multifunctional scaffold protein that
integrates various cellular pathways and interacts with active
(GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) Gα
subunits to negatively regulate G protein signaling. RGS14 is
enriched in area CA2 of the hippocampus where it acts as a natural
suppressor of long-term potentiation. The functional role of RGS14
in CA2 neurons and the mechanisms by which it limits synaptic
plasticity, however, are unknown. The subcellular localization of
proteins in their native cellular environment can provide critical
insight into their in vivo functions. All previous
information about the subcellular localization of RGS14 relied
largely on exogenous expression of recombinant protein in non-host
cells. Since mislocalization of exogenously expressed proteins is a
common problem that can give a false impression of the endogenous
protein's distribution and in vivo
functionalities, the primary aim of this study was to
investigate the subcellular localization of endogenous RGS14 in its
native cellular environment under basal conditions and following G
protein activation. Because CA2 neurons cannot be
isolated for study, we studied RGS14 localization in B35
neuroblastoma cells, the only cell line known to natively express
RGS14. Using immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging, we
found that endogenous RGS14 localizes to multiple cellular
compartments in host B35 cells and that both inactive and activated
G proteins can regulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of RGS14. Our
results suggest that RGS14 may have multiple and complex functions
in CA2 neurons, highlighting the need for future studies to
determine which of these functions is critical for RGS14-mediated
suppression of synaptic plasticity.","Table of Contents -- Background and Significance..1 --

HIV/AIDS Complacency in a National Sample of U.S. Adults","Serial nationally representative surveys describe increases in
HIV/AIDS complacency as a multi-level occurrence reflecting
HIV/AIDS as an issue of diminishing personal concern or national
importance. This phenomenon describes the public agenda on HIV,
which is influenced by media and factors such topic salience within
a community. Domestic and international studies suggest a
relationship between engaging in risky behaviors and complacency
due to HAART-related treatment optimism, as well as a relationship
between stigmatizing or homophobic beliefs with HIV/AIDS
complacency. Plausible causal models developed with MSM suggest
complacency can be operationalized as perceived threat of HIV,
predicted by perceptions of severity and susceptibility to the
disease. Participants were recruited from a nationally
representative online research panel (n=6713). A 10-point item
assessed HIV/AIDS complacency operationalized as perceived threat;
higher scores indicating HIV/AIDS as an important national issue.
One-Way ANOVA and correlations examined bivariate relationships
between complacency and the following variables: age; education;
gender; region; sexual identity; race; treatment optimism; stigma;
homophobia. Participants' mean perceived threat score was 6.5
(SD=2.1). Blacks (M=7.9, SD=2.0) and Hispanics (M=6.7, SD=2.2)
scored higher than whites (M=6.2, SD=2.0). Bivariate analyses
indicated that statistically significant differences in mean
perceived threat score existed among all measures. The final
multivariate model included all measures and explained 18% of the
variance in perceived threat. Decrease perceived threat was related
to treatment optimism, while increased perceived threat was related
stigmatizing beliefs about people with HIV or AIDS, and
non-homophobic beliefs. The largest predictor of perceived threat
was race, potentially because of topic salience in particular
racial/ethnic communities. As complacent individuals are more
likely to engage in risky behaviors, prevention efforts should
consider these individual and community-level differences when
engaging the public with HIV prevention messages.","INTRODUCTION 1 HIV/AIDS Complacency 2 Public Opinion 5 Media and

Interpreter of Trauma Within African American Female Stories","ABSTRACT
ABSTRACT
What ails you?
Implicit within the core axiom of the
dissertation lies the deepened question of what ails you?
The answer drawn from a trajectory of historical accounts of the
Holy Spirit conflated against trauma as both systemic and
individual acts, characterizes the ways in which the human soul,
regardless of race, ethnicity, time or circumstance, perceive
egregious acts of violence at the intersection of the holy. From a
brief perusal of the Holy Spirit within the human experience, I
argue the human soul disconcerted by the chaotic and unbalanced
impulse of trauma responds similarly to the presence of God in the
midst of trouble. Thus, the whole note is not based solely on the
assault that has occurred or its residual effect of injustice
though I categorically referenced these as causes to work towards
eradicating forces which may seek to perpetuate evil and suffering
upon innocent souls, the focus is rather on the ephemeral power of
God to restore and to heal. In this regard, I challenge both
physiological and psychological methods as sole proprietary agents
of trauma treatment to seriously consider the evidence of God/The
Holy Spirit as a crucial; irreducible source of recovery. Moreover,
I believe by instituting the holy in the human narrative, a more
viable means for broadening the scope of trauma care may occur.
Further, I advance the etiological life group of African Americans
whose healing scripts about trauma and injustice lends itself more
toward the embedded narrative within contemporary stories that
count wisdom despite injustice as inscrutable teaching models on
how to withstand suffering in the confluence of peace. Herein, I
advance critical analysis of the African American slave narrative
alongside current traumatic recordings to be potent reiterations of
what constitutes authentic healing in modern-day America's
increasingly pluralistic populace . The study, characterized as
hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, is based on a
qualitative-inductive model experientially designed to detect
movement of the Holy Spirit while drawing an aesthetic link between
slave narratives and the way trauma is recounted in the human
experience. The study began fall, 2011 through May 2014.","CONTENTS --

reviewed,emory:pmtrf,"Hampton, Joya","Effects of atypical antipsychotic use and stress on weight in
individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis","Extant literature suggests that individuals with serious mental
illness are at increased risk for overweight and obesity (Robson
&amp; Gray, 2007), and the introduction of pharmacological
interventions, particularly atypical antipsychotics, puts this
population at greater risk for increased adiposity and metabolic
issues (Green et al., 2000). Research also indicates that those who
suffer from severe mental illness experience greater stress
(Trotman et al., 2014). Given that stress is also related to
overweight and obesity (Adam &amp; Epel, 2007), exploration of the
relationship between atypical antipsychotic medication, stress, and
weight is warranted. This study was a cross-sectional investigation
of atypical antipsychotic use and stress in predicting weight in a
sample of youth at clinical high risk for developing psychosis.
Participant data was obtained as a part of the North American
Prodrome Longitudinal Study Phase 2 (NAPLS-2). Self-reported
weight, atypical antipsychotic use, daily stress (hassles) in the
past 24 hours, and life events stress within the last year were
assessed in clinical high-risk participants who were on and off
atypical antipsychotics at an initial assessment as a part of the
longitudinal study. Individuals taking atypical antipsychotic
medications weighed more than those not taking these medications,
and several measures of stressful events (dependent life events,
desirable life events, and undesirable life events stress) were
correlated with weight. Gender did not moderate the effect of
atypical antipsychotic use on weight but dependent events and
desirable life events stress moderated the relationship between
atypical antipsychotic use and weight. Post hoc analyses revealed
that there was a significant relationship between atypical
antipsychotic use and negative and general symptoms. Findings
suggest that a better understanding of the contribution of stress
to weight gain in this population may be worthwhile to consider in
developing interventions to address psychosocial factors that may
exacerbate or buffer the effects of antipsychotic medication on
weight gain.","-- TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction 1-5 -- Atypical Antipsychotic
