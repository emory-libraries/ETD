Differential Effects of Meditation on Relationship Quality
By Brighid Malloy Kleinman
Relationships are one of the most crucial parts of life and a
highly studied subject
in psychology. Yet psychologists still have difficulty explaining
how to help people gain
and maintain close, positive relationships. The present study aims
to investigate whether
an existing intrapersonal health strategy, meditation, can also
help interpersonal health.
Specifically, psychological and neurobiological evidence suggests
that compassion
mediation in particular may be particularly relevant to close
relationships. Based on
evidence suggesting that compassion - the desire to free others
from suffering - is
strongly related to relationship quality, it is hypothesized that
the cultivation of
compassion through meditation will enhance self-reported
relationship quality.
Furthermore, it is hypothesized that interpersonal (i.e.,
compassion, empathy, and
forgiveness) and intrapersonal (i.e., emotion regulation and
coping) variables will
mediate the relationship between compassion meditation and
relationship quality.","Table of Contents --

among Patients with Multi-Drug Resistant and Extensively
Drug-Resistant (M/XDR) Tuberculosis in the Country of Georgia.","Abstract
Introduction:
Resistance of M. tuberculosis to anti-tuberculosis drugs
has become a
major public health problem in many countries, including Georgia.
In 2008, Georgian
National Tuberculosis Program introduced treatment with second line
anti-tuberculosis
drugs, which has allowed for treatment of multidrug or extensively
drug-resistant
tuberculosis (M/XDR)-TB. The study objectives were to assess
treatment outcomes
among the 1st cohort of patients with pulmonary M/XDR-TB and to
determine risk factors
for poor treatment outcomes: defined as death, failure and
default.
Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was
performed. All patients with
M/XDR pulmonary TB who initiated treatment in 2008 were enrolled
and followed until
2010. Descriptive statistics were used to determine associations
between study
covariates. Binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to
determine independent
association of prior treatment history with treatment outcome while
controlling for
potential confounding variables.
Results: 380 patients were included: male (71%); mean age 38
years; median age 38.4
years. 13% had XDR-TB. 1.3% had HIV co-infection. Body Mass Index
(BMI) was &lt;18.5
among 24% of the cohort, and 52% had bilateral lesions on chest
X-ray. Surgery was
performed in 10% (37) of cases. The treatment outcomes were as
follows: 47% had a
poor outcome (death among 59 patients [15%], failure among 37
[10%], and 83 [22%] -
defaulted). In the final multivariable analysis, history of
previous treatment (OR=2.8 95%
CI 1.2 - 6.3) was significantly associated with poor treatment
after controlling for risk
factors. Other independent variables associated with poor treatment
outcomes included
absence of adjunctive surgical therapy (OR 3.7, 95%CI 1.5, 8.7), no
sputum culture
conversion to negative by 4 months (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.9, 5.0), the
presence of XDR-TB
(OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2, 2.4), BMI &lt; 18.5 (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1, 3.4)
and bilateral lesions on
chest radiograph (OR 1.8, 95%CI 1.2, 2.9).
Conclusions: Overall, 47% of patients with M/XDR-TB had poor
treatment outcome. In
multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for a poor
treatment outcome included
prior TB treatment history, lack of adjunctive surgical
intervention, no culture conversion
by month 4, XDR-TB, low BMI (&lt;18.5) and bilateral lesions on
chest X-ray.

inactive,emory:g2cm7,"Goldfeder, Mark Aaron",Chains of Love in Law; Revisiting Plural Marriage,"This dissertation explores an area at the intersection of
family law, religious liberty and criminal law: the issue of plural
marriage. As American keeps moving in the direction of favoring
consensual adult relationships regardless of their nature, polygamy
has been slowly making a comeback in the national consciousness.
Arguments include First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to
religious liberty, due process, and equality. The first part of
this dissertation explores the issue of legalizing plural marriage
from a legislative and administrative standpoint, while the second
part argues that, regardless of whether or not the technicalities
can be worked out on paper, from a public policy perspective,
polygamy is a poor choice. It argues from experience, with detailed
reference to the Jewish legal system's dramatic move away from the
practice of plural marriage.","Table of Contents -- INTRODUCTION.......................................................................................................................................................................

inactive,emory:8kpw3,"Patel, Pritty Jashvantlal",Role of TMS1/ASC in Breast Epithelial Anoikis and Migration,"Cellular detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM) induces
a form of
apoptosis, referred to as ""anoikis."" Most cancer cells are
resistant to anoikis and survive
independently of ECM interactions. Previously, we identified a
pro-apoptotic gene,
TMS1 that is epigenetically silenced in breast cancers.
Overexpression of TMS1 is
sufficient to induce procaspase-8 cleavage in breast cells in the
absence of death receptor-
ligand interactions. Additionally, TMS1 aggregates to form 'specks'
in some apoptotic
cells, although the function of this structure remains unclear.
Here we established a role
for TMS1 in anoikis and uncovered a nonapoptotic role for TMS1 in
cell migration. We
show that cellular detachment induces TMS1 expression. In addition,
we find that
silencing TMS1 confers resistance to anoikis through a delay in
procaspase-8 cleavage
and accumulation of BimEL. ERK1/2 signaling negatively regulates
BimEL
accumulation during detachment. We found that silencing TMS1
resulted in persistent
ERK1/2 signaling during anoikis. We conclude that loss of TMS1
promotes resistance to
anoikis in part through misregulation of ERK1/2 signaling and
suppression of BimEL
accumulation. During the course of these studies a nonapoptotic
role for procaspase-8 in
adhesion and migration was elucidated by many groups. The next
phase of our research
was aimed towards deciphering a role for TMS1 upstream of
procaspase-8 in anoikis.
Thus, we next investigated a nonapoptotic role for TMS1 in these
processes. We found
that adhesion to fibronectin induced the redistribution of TMS1 to
barrel-like structures.
Silencing TMS1 delayed FAK and ERK1/2 signaling in response to
integrin-fibronectin
interactions. Phosphorylated FAK and centrosomal markers
colocalized with TMS1 at
barrel-like structures in a subset of cells. Through functional
analyses, we further
demonstrated a role for TMS1 in cell migration. These data
suggest that an association of
TMS1 with centrosomes results in the formation of a critical
signaling center that may
regulate migration. In conclusion, our data demonstrate distinct
functions for TMS1 in
anoikis and migration. Overall, results from these studies have
increased our
understanding of the intricate functions TMS1 exhibits in
epithelial cells and has
provided great insight into the consequences of aberrant
methylation and silencing of
TMS1 observed in many cancers.",

Biphenyls, Michigan 1997-2006","Abstract
Depression Medication Use Among Women Exposed to Polybrominated
Biphenyls,
Michigan 1997-2006
Objective: This study examined the potential
association of dietary exposure to
polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), a brominated flame retardant, and
self-reported use of
depression medication among women. PBBs belong to a class of
chemical that have
demonstrated disruption of endocrine systems and pathway. Onset of
depression may be
due to many factors but gender differences in prevalence and the
vulnerability of women
during reproductive lifetime events, such as menses, pregnancy, the
postpartum period
and menopause, suggest the involvement of reproductive
hormones.
Methods: Women exposed to PBB in the early 1970s were
enrolled in a population-based
cohort and provided blood serum samples to ascertain PBB
concentrations in the body.
This study includes 901 women who participated in interviews
conducted in 1997-1998
or in 2003-2006. Information collected during the interviews
included demographics,
lifestyle, medical history, reproductive history, and exposure
history. Logistic regression
models for use of depression medication in the year prior to
interview used enrollment
PBB exposure and current PBB exposure. A general linear mixed decay
model using
enrollment PBB concentrations estimated current PBB concentrations.
All models were
adjusted for PCB levels at enrollment, age at interview, history of
thyroid disease, history
of cancer, BMI at interview, smoking status, and use of hormone
replacement therapy.
Results: Depression medication use in the 12 months
prior to interview was reported for
133 women, with an overall prevalence of 14.8%. This study did not
find an association
between exposure to PBB and depression medication usage among
women, however
among current or former smokers with PBB exposure an increased
likelihood of
depression medication use was observed compared to non-smokers with
low PBB
exposure. (Current PBB &lt;0.85 ppb: OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.32;
Current PBB 0.85 ≤ 2.4
ppb: OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.00-3.43; Enrollment PBB ≤1 ppb: OR
1.56, 95% CI 1.05-2.30;
Enrollment PBB 1 - 4 ppb: OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41)
Conclusion: This study suggests that PBB exposure
increases the chance of depression
among women who are current or former smokers. Additional research
should explore
the interaction between PBBs and smoking and depression associated
with altered
hormone pathways.","Table of Contents -- Chapter I: Literature Review

Exposure in Michigan","In a study of geographic distribution of human exposure to
polybrominated biphenyl in the Michigan PBB Registry, following a
contamination incident in 1973, PBB quarantined farms are
investigated for their potential as sites of environmental
contamination and continued human exposure to PBB. Spatial
distribution maps were created to describe human PBB exposure from
1976-1979, quarantined farms, estimated decay rates, and breast
cancer rates by county. Univariate geostatistical analyses assessed
global and local autocorrelation. Bivariate geostatistical analyses
evaluated global and local autocorrelation of human PBB exposure,
estimated decay rates, and breast cancer rates with the number of
quarantined farms in Michigan counties. A land use analysis
measured the area of agricultural land in 1978 developed into urban
land use in 1992, in counties with the highest number of
quarantined farms. No significant global autocorrelation was found
across the state of Michigan for any variable, with the exception
of mean breast cancer rates. Results of the local univariate
analyses indicated differential distribution of PBB exposure. Three
major areas associated with higher human PBB exposure were located
around the city of Grand Rapids, in the thumb of Michigan's lower
peninsula, and in the southwestern corner of the state. Bivariate
significant autocorrelation with quarantined farms was found at
these same locations. The land use analyses revealed counties
located around the city of Grand Rapids had the greatest total land
area transition from agriculture to urban land use. In the thumb of
the state, significant bivariate autocorrelation identified an area
of high of quarantined farms and slower decay rates. In conclusion,
this study identifies areas of Michigan associated with higher
human exposure to PBB in 1976-1979. This analysis suggests that
counties around the city of Grand Rapids have a higher potential
for continued human exposure to PBB from quarantined farms and that
slower rates of decay found in the thumb of the state, can
potentially be attributed to continued human exposure from
quarantined farms. The implications of these findings can be better
understood through environmental sampling, more detailed land use
data analyses, and continued spatial analyses of point
locations.","INTRODUCTION 1 -- METHODS 14 -- Study Population: Michigan PBB

Informing intervention strategies using quantitative methods
by Glen R. Abedi
Youth sexual and reproductive health represents an area of
healthcare that is in particular need of
development in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, little research on this
subject has been conducted to date
to guide policy and programming. CARE Northwest Balkans, a regional
subsidiary of CARE
International, completed a quantitative survey on youth sexual and
reproductive health in Bosnia-
Herzegovina in 2006. Respondents consisted(Mann, Drucker,
Tarantola, &amp; McCabe, 1994) of university
students above the age of 18. They answered questions about their
behaviors and attitudes associated with
sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and related behaviors.
The largest ethnic group represented in the sample was Serbs
(71.56%), followed by Bosniaks
(23.85%). The median age of respondents was 22.21 years. Only 5.50%
of respondents reported ever
having been tested for sexually transmitted infections (STI)
although 69.72% reported having engaged in
sexual intercourse in the previous year. The most popular sources
of information on sexual and
reproductive health were TV &amp; radio, printed materials, and
school. The effectiveness of these sources of
information as avenues for public health communications remains
unclear.

Michigan Chemical Corporation and Pine River Community","Purpose: After the industrial accident in
1973 in Michigan exposed thousands of people to polybrominated
biphenyls (PBB), the Michigan PBB Registry was started to track the
exposed to conduct research on health outcomes. In the 1990s those
who were former chemical workers of Michigan Chemical Corporation
and their families were dropped from the registry due to multiple
exposures. In 2014, former PBB Registry participants were invited
to re-join the Registry. This study aims to characterize the
chemical workers, their families, and others living in the
St.Louis/Pine River area who may have been exposed to PBB and other
persistent organic pollutants.
Methods: Blood samples were collected from
participants in December, 2013 and in March, 2014. Serum was
analyzed for PBB153, DDT and DDE isomers, and HBB.
Participant's serum concentrations were coupled with
questionnaire data about their demographic
classifications. Univariate statistics were used to describe
the study cohort's chemical distributions. The study
cohort distributions were compared with NHANES
2003-2004 distributions as a baseline indicator of national
background concentrations. Linear regression was performed on
natural log transformed PBB153 and p,p-DDE concentrations as the
dependent outcomes with covariates of the different
classifications.
Results: Chemical workers had significantly
higher PBB153 concentrations than the other three classifications
of participants that stayed significant when adjusted for age and
gender. Family members of chemical workers had significantly higher
PBB153 concentrations than the other two classifications of
participants that stayed significant when adjusted for age and
gender. Age was the only strong predictor of p,p-DDE
concentrations. All participants measured below the level of
detection for DDT isomers, o,p-DDE, and HBB. The overall
distribution of the study cohort had elevated PBB153 concentrations
compared with the NHANES 2003-2004 data.
Conclusion: This study highlights the need
for chemical workers and their families to be included back into
the Michigan PBB Registry, as they represent a highly exposed
population to PBB. Future studies should focus on linking
environmental sampling of persistent organic pollutants in St.
Louis/Pine River to human exposures -
including reassessing DDT/DDE/DDD as well as other compounds
such as PCB, PBDE, and dieldrin.","Introduction......................................1 --

Determinants of Uncontrolled Blood Pressure among African
Americans using Electronic Medical Records, 2008-2011
By Yi-Ting Chou
Hypertension is a common chronic disease affecting more than 75
million adults in the United States. Particularly in African
Americans, hypertension is more common, more severe, develops at an
earlier age, and leads to more clinical sequelae. Moreover,
Hypertension control rates in the United States remain lower in
African Americans compared to Caucasians. Nevertheless, potential
risk factors of uncontrolled hypertension have not been
sufficiently investigated in clinical population.
To understand the multidimensional determinants of uncontrolled
blood pressure in African Americans, we used an electronic medical
record system in Georgia and identified a sample of 3,135 newly
treated hypertensive African Americans aged ≥20. The primary
outcomes of interest were 1) Blood pressure (BP) controlled or not
after treatment, and 2) the quantitative changes in SBP and DBP
before and after treatment. Potential risk factors examined
included age, sex, BMI, Socioeconomic status socioeconomic status,
medication adherence, the use of diuretics or calcium channel
blockers, comorbidities. The associations of risk factors with
blood pressure and uncontrolled hypertension were examined by
linear and logistic regression models, respectively.
Under the unadjusted model, medication adherence (medication
possession ratio ≥0.8) was significantly associated with BP
control with a reduction of 5.4 and 3.3 mmHg compared to
non-adherent patient in SBP and DBP respectively. The use of
diuretics was associated with a reduction in SBP while the use of
CCB was observed with association in both SBP and DBP response.
Diabetes (DM), stroke, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end stage
renal disease (ESRD) were associated with SBP increases even after
treatment. Controlling for age, sex, BMI, and medication adherence,
diuretics was still significantly associated with a SBP reduction
but not DBP. DM was associated with DBP reduction, while CKD or
ESRD was associated with increases in SBP, respectively. Low SES is
associated with less reduction of SBP and DBP among treated African
Americans.
We concluded that adherence to antihypertensive medication, the
comorbidity, and the category of antihypertensive medication
strongly influenced BP response among African Americans.","Table of Contents -- Background/Literature

Biological Pattern Recognition Approach","Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into
all somatic cell types, making them a useful platform for studying
a variety of cellular phenomenon. Furthermore, ESCs can be induced
to form aggregates called embryoid bodies (EBs) which recapitulate
the dynamics of development and morphogenesis. However, many
different factors such as gradients of soluble morphogens, direct
cell-to-cell signaling, and cell-matrix interactions have all been
implicated in directing ESC differentiation. Though the effects of
individual factors have often been investigated independently, the
inherent difficulty in assaying combinatorial effects has made it
difficult to ascertain the concerted effects of different
environmental parameters, particularly due to the spatial and
temporal dynamics associated with such cues. Dynamic computational
models of ESC differentiation can provide powerful insight into how
different cues function in combination both spatially and
temporally. By combining particle based diffusion models, cellular
agent based approaches, and physical models of morphogenesis, a
multi-scale, rules-based modeling framework can provide insight
into how each component contributes to differentiation. I propose
to investigate the complex regulatory cues which govern complex
morphogenic behavior in 3D ESC systems via a computational rules
based modeling approach. The objective of this study is to examine
how spatial patterns of differentiation by ESCs arise as a function
of the microenvironment. The central hypothesis is that spatial
control of soluble morphogens and cell-cell signaling will allow
enhanced control over the patterns and efficiency of stem cell
differentiation in embryoid bodies.",

Cultivating Our Conversation:
The Christian Practice of Nonviolent Discourse in the Public
Square
By Jason G. Williamson
Christian discourse in the public square in America today needs to
be
changed. This paper proposes that the practice of nonviolent
discourse is
necessary when Christians engage in the public square. The
historical
Augustinian dualism that leads to a divisive attitude of ""us"" vs.
""them"" must be
rejected in favor of an inclusive manner of engagement. When
speaking publicly,
Christians should replace moral certitude with theological humility
and allow an
agapic ethic to inform their speech. In this way, nonviolent
discourse represents
a living faith that authentically reflects Jesus' commands to love
one another.
Jubilee Partners, an intentional Christian community, provides an
example of
this type of public nonviolent discourse.

Reconciliation for the Korean Church in the Conflict between
""Comfort Women"" and Japanese Government","There is ongoing conflict between ""comfort women"", who were
exploited as a sexual slavery by Japan during World War II, and
present Japanese government; this conflict has been sustained by
Japanese government's official denial of sexual slavery during the
war time. My thesis aims at resolving this ongoing conflict between
two parties in terms of the language of reconciliation from my
reflection and reconstruction of 1) Christian theology and ethics
and 2) circumstances in other contexts over the world. I
particularly focus on an agency of the Korean church in the process
of reconciliation.
In the first and second chapter, I intend to suggest a sound theory
of reconciliation in light of a compatible relation between agape
and justice in the age of peace-building. Nurturing agape
transforms justice from liberal justice - mere fairness and strict
punishment - to restorative justice - restoring the right
relationship. Restorative justice is the indispensable part of
agape, and it also prevents agape from lapsing into injustice. Both
nurturing agape and restorative justice shared a moral vision of
restoration of the right relationship - bringing down the dividing
of walls of hostility in the world of injustice and violence. In
the third chapter, I try to persuade the Korean church to become an
agent of reconciliation between ""comfort women"" and the Japanese
government. I explored the richness of Christian languages of
reconciliation in Christian tradition: 1) the Christology and
Ecclesiology of Barth and Bonhoeffer and 2) the Pauline theology
interpreted by Volf and Lederach.
In the rest of chapters I intend to develop possible practices of
the Korean church in order to facilitate the process of
reconciliation between ""comfort women"" and Japanese government. In
the fourth chapter, I first explored the social context and
location of ""comfort women"" by borrowing a Korean ethos, Han -
suppressed pain from injustice or oppression. In the fifth and
sixth chapters I suggested four practices of the Korean church -
acknowledgement, reparations, apology, and forgiveness - for
healing wounds of ""comfort women"" and restoring the right
relationship between them and the Korean church, Korean society,
and Japanese government.","TABLE OF CONTENT -- INTRODUCTION 1 -- SECTION I: A THEORY OF

draft,emory:gjgr2,"Williams, John Patrick","A Review of
Popular Glucose Tracking Apps and Use of mHealth by Latinos with
Diabetes","Background: Diabetes in the United States is a pervasive
chronic disease, contributing to hundreds of thousands of deaths
each year. Latinos in particular suffer from higher rates of
complications and diabetes-related mortality than non-Hispanic
Whites. mHealth is a promising new treatment modality for diabetes,
though few smartphone apps have been designed specifically for
Latinos.
Objectives: (1) To identify common features of popular
glucose tracking apps; (2) To determine the use of these apps among
a sample of online Hispanics in the U.S.
Methods: First, twenty popular diabetes apps were
reviewed to ascertain the most prevalent features and
functionalities. Second, an online survey was fielded through a
popular health website for Latinos inquiring about respondents' use
of diabetes apps.
Results:
App review: Approximately one-third of apps were
available in Spanish. The most common features were blood glucose
recording/annotation and activity logs. Most apps permitted
exportation of data via e-mail but only a third enabled uploading
to an online account. Twenty percent of apps could connect directly
with a glucometer, and 30% had reminder functionalities prompting
patients to take medications or check blood glucose levels.
Online survey: Over 1,600 surveys were completed. Over
90% of respondents were from the United States, including Puerto
Rico. The majority of respondents used a device running on an
Android platform while only a quarter used an iPhone. Use of
diabetes apps was approximately 3% among diabetics and 3.6% among
diabetics who also had a smartphone. Among app users, blood glucose
and medication diaries were the most frequently used
functionalities while hemoglobin A1c and insulin diaries were the
least used. The majority of app users did not share their progress
on social media though many of these were willing to share it with
their doctor.
Conclusions: Many Latinos do not possess the diabetes
knowledge or self-awareness to fully benefit from the most
prevalent functionalities offered by the most popular diabetes
apps. We recommend developers incorporate more basic features such
as diabetes education, reminder functionalities, Spanish language
interfaces, and glucometer connectivities.","Chapter I: Introduction -- Context of

Humans, Animals, and the Image of God: An Examination of
Difference in Kind
and Difference of Degree Arguments for Human Uniqueness and
Superiority
Image of God language from the Genesis 1 account of creation has
often been
used to justify human superiority over nature. A significant
problem with this
approach is that the text does not identify what it means to be
created imago dei
and throughout history the God-­‐like characteristic
associated with humans has
changed. This paper is an examination of the historical and
traditional uses of
image of God language along with modern reinterpretations of
these
perspectives that use both difference in kind and difference of
degree
arguments. In addition, this paper examines how claims for human
superiority
are undermined in light of modern scientific advances in biology,
ethology, and
archaeology and whether or not image of God language should be used
in or is
helpful for religious discourse in the present day.","Table of Contents -- I. -- An Image Problem -- 1 -- II. -- Church

non-pathogenic SIV infection","After more than twenty-five years of strenuous research, an
effective AIDS vaccine to prevent
HIV infection has yet to be developed. This is largely due to a
lack of understanding of how HIV
interacts with the human immune system and causes pathogenesis. The
goal of my thesis was to
better understand determinants of viremia during HIV pathogenesis
by utilizing non-human
primate models. Natural SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SMs)
provides a non-pathogenic
model of HIV, since despite high levels of viremia, these animals
maintain peripheral CD4+ T
cells and do not progress to AIDS. Pathogenic SIV infection of
rhesus macaques (RMs),
however, is a widely used model for HIV in humans since these
animals have high viremia,
depletion of peripheral CD4+ T cells, and eventual progression to
AIDS. In the first aim of my
thesis, I assessed the determinants of set-point viremia in
naturally SIV-infected SMs, i.e.,
immune control versus target cell limitation. To address this
issue, I depleted CD4+ T cells in
naturally SIV-infected SMs, and found that set-point viremia is
determined by the availability of
activated CD4+ T cells, but not measures of immune control. In the
second aim of my thesis, I
sought to better understand the role of CD8+ T cells during
pathogenic SIV infection of RMs by
determining the lifespan of SIV-infected cells in vivo
either in the presence (control) or absence
(CD8+ lymphocyte-depleted) of CD8+ T cells. I found that depletion
of CD8+ lymphocytes did
not result in an increased lifespan of productively infected cells
in vivo, which indicates that
direct killing of cells producing virus is unlikely to be a major
mechanism underlying the anti-
viral effect of CD8+ T cells during SIV infection. Taken together,
the results of my thesis studies
have important implications for the development of AIDS vaccines
and therapies. These studies
provide a significant improvement in our understanding of the
complex interactions between HIV
and the immune system, and will hopefully lead to a re-analysis of
current HIV vaccination
strategies in order to produce more efficacious vaccines with
appropriate targets.","Table of Contents -- Chapter One: Thesis Introduction

a half, the Mexican intelligentsia approached the question of work
and its opposites in its attempts to explain the seeming
contradiction of a Mexico that was materially rich yet which
languished in underdevelopment. To this end, I trace
the constitution of what I call the Mexican ""archive of work""
through key moments in the nation's cultural history in which
attempts were made to articulate a work ethic capable of delivering
the nation into prosperity, while at the same time remaining
authentically Mexican. I define the ""archive of work"" as a
discursive matrix composed of three conceptual nuclei--the
Christian notion of duty, the liberal notion of work as
self-development, and the thermodynamic and scientistic notion of
metabolic work--which determines all discussions of work and its
opposites in modern Mexico. My chapters engage a wide array of
written cultural objects that spans a variety of genres: from the
assorted writings, legislations, articles, speeches and novels of
19th century liberal and conservative lettered elite, to
the textual production--philosophical treatises, essays, and
novels--of the mid twentieth century. Together, these documents
allow for an exploration of the idea of work in Mexico and the
ontological and political narratives about man's place in the world

Olympic Games","Abstract
Inside the Perimeter:
Urban Development in Atlanta since the 1996 Olympic Games
In the 1990s the population of the city of Atlanta grew for the
first time since the
early 1970s. Many of the newly arrived residents were white and
middle class and this
contrasted with the city's recent history which had been marked by
decades of white
flight and extreme class bifurcation. Far from a spontaneous
reversal, Atlanta's business
and political leaders had been working together for years to
counteract the pull of the
suburbs and attract middle class residents to the city. This
partnership has been called a
governing regime and it worked to take advantage of increasingly
global networks of
capital and people to create the thriving cosmopolitan city
Atlanta's leaders have
dreamed of since the Civil War.
This dissertation examines the changes that have taken place in
Atlanta's physical
and social landscape since the city hosted the Olympic Games in
1996 and places these
changes within their local, national and global historical context.
In addition to
examining the global economic situation within which these changes
took place and the
governing regime that steered the city through these networks, this
dissertation analyses
the development of a tourist infrastructure in Downtown, the
phenomenon of Intown
gentrification and the creation of a consumer driven ""live, work
and play"" neighborhood
called Atlantic Station.
The governing regime is characterized as pro-Third Way because it
defines the
role of local government as facilitator for private business. This
relationship has been
arguably successful in recreating parts of the city but it has
often done so at the expense
of those who are least able to take advantage of the market.
Whether it be from the
destruction of public housing, displacement due to gentrification
or increased antagonism
toward the homeless, the city's most vulnerable residents are

draft,emory:pqnnq,"Deveau, Todd Carter",Enhancements of Cellular Therapy for Ischemic Stroke,"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability
in the United States. Treatment options are currently limited, and
currently only one FDA-approved therapy exists (tPA). Although tPA
was a great stride forward in stroke treatment, only a small
percentage of patients are eligible to receive the drug and even
smaller actually receive it. Research to date has focused on small
molecule and peptide based therapies aimed at neuroprotection:
protecting dying neurons, glia, and vascular from ischemia-media
cell death. Decades of pre-clinical studies generated exciting
results in animal models, however all have failed to translate to
successful patient care. Currently, there are no therapies
available to promote central nervous system (CNS recovery) in
stroke survivors. Cellular therapy, the use of stem cells for
stroke treatment, has blossomed in the lab in the past decade.
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells, or iPSCs) in particular
are an excellent candidate for future stroke therapies. With
multiple mechanisms of action and the possibility for not only
neuronal cell replacement but personalized medicine as well, the
use of iPSCs for stroke therapy holds great potential. Current
studies generate as proof-of-principal that iPSC transplantation
can be safe, efficacious, and can provide a source of new neurons
that integrate into host circuitry. While these studies are
exciting, they are far from ideal. Many questions remain and in its
current form, iPSC transplantation for stroke is not optimized and
remains inefficient. This dissertation examines how iPSC
transplantation may be optimized for ischemic stroke treatment. We
examined a novel intranasal transplantation route as well as a
novel genetic manipulation method (focal adhesion kinase, FAK,
overexpression we hypothesized would improve functional recovery
over current methods. Our results suggest that the novel
non-invasive intranasal transplantation may improve functional
recovery at a similar level compared to existing methods. We also
demonstrate FAK overexpression may improve some aspects of normal
neuronal development that would aid the integration of
transplantated cells. Taken together, our data suggest that
optimization of existing iPSC transplantation methods may benefit
iPSC therapy for ischemic stroke.","CHAPTER 1 - ISCHEMIC STROKE 1 -- INTRODUCTION 2 -- ISCHEMIC STROKE

Paul on the Road to Natchez: Conversion and Resurrection in the
Christ-Haunted South
By Mary Elizabeth Button
Paul on the Road to Natchez is a project that is comprised
of both paintings and essays in
which the conversion of Paul is imagined at various sites along the
Natchez Trace. In
each of the fifteen pieces in the series, well-know images of
Saul's conversion (some
from art history, others from family Bibles) have been reproduced
within an illustration
of sites along the Natchez Trace. Saul's journey to Damascus, and
the blinding light of
the resurrected Christ that transforms Saul into Paul, provides the
narrative structure for
the project.

Transfusions:
Mechanisms, Consequences, and Interventions

By
Seema Rajnikant Patel
In response to vasculature injury, anucleated cell fragments,
referred to as platelets,
adhere and aggregate to damaged blood vessels to preserve
hemostasis through clot
formation and wound healing. Platelet disorders resulting in low
platelet counts or
dysfunctional platelets can require aggressive platelet transfusion
support to aid in
maintaining proper hemostasis levels. Although a vital therapy,
platelet transfusions are
associated with long-term clinical consequences, such as
development of donor specific
alloimmunity and consequential refractoriness to subsequent
platelet transfusions.
When successful, bone marrow transplantations are a potential cure
for the above
patients. In a non-malignant setting, eligible patients can receive
Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow transplant. Due to the absence of
neoplasia in
such patients, it is difficult to justify the toxic effects of
stringent conditioning regimens
that are otherwise beneficial in eradicating cancerous cells and
promoting engraftment.
Thus, many physicians choose to transplant under reduced intensity
conditions.
However, under these conditions, it is observed that chronically
transfused patients
reject the HLA-matched bone marrow transplant at higher rates than
minimally or un-
transfused patients. Because the transplants are HLA-matched or
-identical, it is
predicted that rejection is due to minor histocompatibility
antigens. Therefore, the goal
of the current dissertation is to test and characterize the role of
prior alloimmunization
against minor histocompatibility antigens, expressed by transfused
platelet units, in the
rejection of an MHC-identical, unrelated donor bone marrow
transplant. The data
presented herein demonstrate that minor histocompatibility
antigen reactive cellular
alloimmunity induced in response to allogeneic leukocyte reduced
platelet transfusions
can induce rejection of a subsequent MHC-matched bone marrow
transplant expressing
the target minor histocompatibility antigens under reduced
intensity conditions. To the
extent that the observed murine biology reflects human physiology,
these findings
additionally indicate potential clinical interventions to overcome
refractoriness to platelet
or red blood cell transfusions and rejection of an HLA-matched
transplant under
reduced intensity conditions in allogeneic platelet transfused
patients.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1 - Introduction --

Islands of Memory: The Sea Islands, Black Women Artists, and the
Promise of Home
By Folashadé Alao

This study examines the development and construction of the Sea
Islands as a
significant cultural landscape in the black imagination and
historicizes the processes
informing the Sea Islands' contemporary emergence as a site of
memory. The
coalescence of cultural and academic interests, the publication of
new research materials
on the Sea Islands, and the discovery and republication of old
works, such as Drums and
Shadows, during the 1970's enabled the Sea Islands to emerge in
the national black
imagination in new ways that black visual artists and writers would
illuminate. The
movement of Gullah culture into the mainstream and the elevation of
the Sea Islands as a
site of memory were aided particularly by literary, dramatic,
musical, and visual arts and
the sustained interests and creative expressions of different
groups of artists.
This study focuses on the particular visualizations of the Sea
Islands in Paule
Marshall's Praisesong for the Widow (1983), Gloria Naylor's
Mama Day (1988), and
Julie Dash's film Daughters of the Dust (1991) and novel
Daughters of the Dust (1997).
Specifically, I underscore the sources they draw upon to construct
their visions; the
voices, images, and histories they challenge; the functions they
hope such a vision will
hold for their readers; and their works' place within the Sea
Islands Cultural Renaissance
which surrounds their publication. Marshall, Naylor, and Dash's
works capture and
respond to a transforming relationship between African Americans
and their African
ancestry as well as to the southern landscape, both of which
resulted from the social and
political struggles of the 1960s and 1970s and a shift in black
migratory patterns in the
1970s. Marshall, Naylor, and Dash's works also reflect a renewed
critical study of
African American origins and genealogy, and the increasing concerns
surrounding the
transformations of black urban and rural life. The Sea Islands, in
these works, emerge as
a site of intersections, continuity, and reconnections with
southern homeplaces, distant
African memories, submerged oral histories, and neglected cultural
traditions.","Table of Contents -- Introduction -- 5 -- Chapter 1 -- ""A Sacred

James in the ""Q"" Sayings Tradition: An Examination of the
Jesus Logia in the Epistle of St. James
The present investigation concerns itself with assessing the
relationship between the Epistle of
James and the sayings traditions of Jesus, as found in the
Synoptics. For most observers, the use of Jesus
logia
reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the nature and
extent of the affinities between James and the Gospels remain a
matter of debate among scholars. The
questions raised
revolve around debates over which
passages in James are identifiable as derivative of a Jesus
logion. Secondarily, the extent to which James
utilizes such traditions has been recognized as a possible window
into the Sitz im Leben of the Jamesian
community (itself a notoriously difficult question).
The thesis which guides the present discussion can be stated as
follows: the Epistle of James
represents an early stage in the development of the Jesus tradition
found in the Synoptic Gospels.
Correspondingly, it reflects a pre-gospel stage of development in
the sayings of Jesus, reminiscent of the
form found in the Q source (particularly in its Matthean
recension). The two test cases for this hypothesis
will be Jas 2:5 and Jas 5:12. The reason for the selection of these
passages in particular is that they are
nearly universally accepted
of the words of Jesus. Before undertaking
an exegesis of these passages it will be necessary to briefly
review the relevant literature, in order to see
how Jamesian scholarship has developed from its origins to its
current state. Following the exegesis of the
targeted verses in James, we will conclude our investigation with a
summary of our findings and an
assessment of their implications.

activity","Abstract
Engineering kinases for dual thymidine and thymidylate kinase
activity
By Yichen Liu
Thymidine kinase (TK) and thymidylate kinase (TMPK) are essential
enzymes
that function in the salvage pathway for synthesis of thymidine
triphosphate, a DNA
building block. Their importance also exists in activating
nucleoside analogs (NAs), an
important category of anti-cancer and anti-virus drugs. Because NAs
enter the cell as
prodrugs, they require three consecutive phosphorylation steps
catalyzed by cellular
kinases in the salvage pathway to become biologically active and
halt DNA synthesis.
Among the cellular kinases responsible for NA activation, the first
two
phosphorylation steps usually present the bottleneck because of
their poor activity
towards NA. Previous engineering efforts to alter and improve
specificity of these
kinases have largely focused on the first step of phosphorylation
catalyzed by
deoxyribonucleoside kinase (dNK). However, such approach bears the
real risk of simply
shifting the bottleneck from the improved first to the second
phosphorylation reaction. A
more promising strategy is to eliminate both bottleneck steps by
creating a dual
functioning enzyme that can convert NAs directly to their
corresponding diphosphate
form. In this dissertation, I developed a conditional auxotroph E.
coli strain for the
selection of dual TK and TMPK activity. As the first selection
system reported for
selecting two consecutive reactions, this auxotroph strain enables
the evaluation of
combinatorial kinase libraries for TK and TMPK activities both
independently and
concurrently. Employing the dual-function auxotroph strain, I have
evaluated chimera
libraries of dNK from Drosophila melanogaster and TMPK from
Thermotoga maritima
using the non-homologous recombination technique SCRATCHY in
combination with
the computational method SCHEMA. Separately, more fundamental
questions
concerning the mechanistic similarities and differences between
these two enzymatic
reactions were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and ITC
studies of substrate
binding. Experiments were conducted on DmdNK and TmTMPK, which
excusively
catalyze the first or second phosphorylation reaction, as well as
the only know dual-
function TK from herpes simplex virus (HSV). The information
extracted from these
experiments provides new insights regarding the dual function of
HSV1-TK and will
guide future engineering experiments.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1 General introduction.

transferrin
receptor levels in non-pregnant women of Papua-New-Guinea
Background:
Iron deficiency anemia is a global threat especially in
the
third world countries and is associated with significant morbidity
and
mortality. Transferrin receptor (TfR) levels are indicators of iron
depletion
and can detect low iron levels before clinical anemia sets in.
Inflammation
and acute phase reaction are associated with iron deficiency and
anemic
status, thus it is instructive to assess the relationship between
transferrin
receptor levels and markers of inflammation and acute phase
reaction
such as AGP and CRP.

Objective: This study aims to determine if there is an
association between
elevation of the acute phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and
α1-acid
glycoprotein (AGP) and elevated transferrin receptor levels (TfR),
in
Papua New Guinean non-pregnant women 15-49 years of age who
participated in the 2005 Papua New Guinea National
Micronutrient
Survey.

Methods: The 2005 Papua New Guinea National Micronutrient
Survey
was a stratified PPS survey with a 2-stage cluster design. Data on
866
non-pregnant women 15-49 years of age were used in the
analysis.
Logistic regression models accounting for complex samples design
were
used to assess the relationship between elevated AGP and elevated
TfR
status and between elevated CRP and elevated TfR status.

Results: The overall prevalence of elevated TfR was 20.6%
in the study
population. The prevalence of elevated CRP and elevated AGP was
9.0%
and 7.4%, respectively. Both CRP and AGP were significantly
associated
with TfR in Papua New Guinean non-pregnant women aged 15-49
years.
For CRP,there seemed to be a weak association between CRP and TfR
in
urban areas compared to rural areas where this association is very
strong.
For AGP, OR=3.38 (95% CI: 1.51,7.54) controlling for the
confounders
and significant groups.
Conclusions: This study suggests that there is a
significant relationship
between acute phase reactants AGP and CRP and indicator of
iron
depletion status TfR and that the former should be part of all
nutrition
surveys to identify iron depletion. Future studies should explore
the
relationship under different environments and at different cutoff

The Role of Rap1 Signaling during Prostate Cancer
Progression
and its Potential Regulator, the PI3K/Akt Pathway
By Veronica Mwihaki Henderson
Rap1 is a small G-protein implicated in the regulation of
E-cadherin cell-cell junctions
and integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions. Our expression
profiling of clinical prostate
cancer tissue samples showed significantly decreased Rap1A mRNA
levels in tumor
compared to normal tissue samples, while a negative regulator of
Rap1, Rap1GAP, was
significantly increased. Furthermore, these changes in Rap1A and
Rap1GAP expression
were significantly correlated with Gleason tumor grade, suggesting
that reduced Rap1
signals play a role in metastatic progression. Tissue microarray
analysis confirmed this
correlation at the protein level for Rap1GAP. Furthermore, siRNA
knockdown of Rap1A
and Rap1B resulted in increased LNCaP cell migration as measured in
a wound healing
assay. Stable expression of the PTEN tumor suppressor in C4-2
prostate cancer cells
resulted in changes in cell morphology as well as increased Rap1
protein levels,
suggesting that the PI3K/AKT pathway may regulate Rap1 expression.
Treatment of
prostate cancer cells with an inhibitor of PI3K increased mRNA
expression of the Rap1A
and Rap1B genes, supporting this hypothesis. Thus, activation of
the PI3K/AKT pathway
may be one mechanism by which Rap1 expression is repressed during
prostate cancer
progression, resulting in enhanced cell migration.

nonEmo Phenotype in C. elegans Oocytes","I am currently investigating a novel oocyte phenotype in
the nematode C. elegans. Unlike human oocytes, which remain
meiotically arrested unless fertilized, ovulated C. elegans
oocytes undergo continuous endomitotic DNA replication and
consequentially become polyploid when left unfertilized. Wild type
(WT) worms therefore, are said to have an ""Emo""
(endomitotic oocyte)
phenotype. A novel ""nonEmo"" phenotype was discovered when a strain
that contained him-8(e1462) was found to produce
ovulated oocytes that remained arrested in meiotic prophase I when
left unfertilized. Because oocyte meiotic arrest would greatly aid
in the process of realizing an in vitro fertilization (IVF)
model in C. elegans, understanding the genetic basis of this
strain's nonEmo phenotype is important, as it has the potential to
produce oocytes of a quantity and quality suitable for IVF in C.
elegans. C. elegans fertilization in vivo is
difficult to observe, as it is tightly coupled to ovulation and
occurs rapidly in a chamber (the spermatheca) filled with sperm
that block the view of the oocyte. IVF is desired, as it would
allow for an unobstructed view of sperm-oocyte interactions prior
to fertilization and control of variables such as the location,
time, and environment of sperm-egg binding. IVF would also allow
detailed spatial and temporal analyses of sperm mutants that
exhibit defects during fertilization. I have used PCR, DNA
sequencing, RNAi technology, and conventional genetics to show that
loss-of-function mutations in the gene C10C5.1 are
responsible for the nonEmo phenotype. This gene encodes a Piezo
protein, which is postulated to function as a mechanosensitive ion
channel. My work has taken a strain that harbored multiple
mutations and clearly shown that the nonEmo phenotype results from
loss-of-function for one gene. Future work will focus
on determining the tissue in which lack of C10C5.1 expression
causes the nonEmo phenotype. Along with investigating how the
nonEmo phenotype is regulated, further work will need to be
performed to determine if C10C5.1 mutants are in fact suitable
oocyte donors for IVF.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Introduction -- A. Caenorhabditis

Characteristic in Mixed-Sex Dyads","Abstract

The physical attractiveness bias, the tendency to attribute
positive characteristics to
attractive people, is ubiquitous in the social world and
appropriates widespread
advantages to attractive individuals. Past research has shown that
physical attractiveness
operates as a status characteristic that influences group behavior.
Incorporating concepts
from the physical attractiveness bias and expectation states
theory, this study examines
the communication behaviors of pairs working on a decision making
task in order to draw
conclusions about the unconscious influence of physical
attractiveness and gender on
social status hierarchy. 68 undergraduate students were separated
into pairs that varied by
gender and attractiveness rating and were videotaped while
performing a task.
Researchers measured the dominant (interruptions, gestures, total
talk time, speech
initiation) and submissive (affirmations, head nods, smiling)
communication behaviors
exhibited by participants and used this information to infer the
status hierarchy of the
pair. When participants evaluated their partners after the task,
participants who were
described as attractive were also described as possessing other
positive traits, such as
intelligence or thoughtfulness. A 2 (Attractiveness) by 2 (Gender)
Factorial ANOVA was
significant for speech initiation and head nods. These interactions
and other trends
suggest that gender and physical attractiveness operate as status
characteristics, and that
physical attractiveness affords individuals an elevated social
status in face-to-face
interaction.","Table of Contents -- Introduction

Systematic Reviews Produced by the Guide to Community Preventive
Services and the Recommendations and Findings Issued by the
Task Force on Community Preventive Services, 2000-2010","Background: An increasing demand for evidence-based
healthcare is placing new
emphasis on the methodological quality of systematic reviews. The
Guide to Community
Preventive Services (the Community Guide) was developed to
conduct systematic
reviews evaluating the effectiveness of public health
interventions. Each intervention is
issued a finding from the Task Force on Community Preventive
Services (Task Force),
based on the strength of the evidence obtained in the review. These
findings and
recommendations are increasingly being implemented in public health
policies and
programs.
Objective: To determine the association between
methodological reporting quality in
Community Guide systematic reviews and the corresponding Task Force
finding. We
also sought to evaluate the effect that three covariates
(publication year, topic area, or
the type of intervention considered in the review) have on the
methodological reporting
quality.
Methods: Community Guide systematic reviews were selected
from five topic areas,
and from each review that satisfied the inclusion and exclusion
criteria, data were
extracted on descriptive information, quality of the included
studies, methodological
reporting quality (based on five selected methodological
characteristics), and the Task
Force finding. Associations between the methodological reporting
quality and the Task
Force finding, and the effects of the three covariates on the
methodological reporting
quality, were evaluated using logistic regression modeling
techniques.
Results: In the 72 systematic reviews included, the average
number of methodological
characteristics addressed was 1.72 out of a possible 5. A Task
Force finding of strong
evidence vs. insufficient evidence was significantly associated
with increased
methodological reporting score (OR=2.31) and increased study
quality score (OR=2.24).
Significant associations of similar magnitude were also observed
for the comparison of
sufficient vs. insufficient evidence. Reporting of the individual
methodological
characteristics was significantly different at varying values of
the three covariates
evaluated.
Conclusions: All findings are of importance in public
health, whether a
recommendation with strong evidence supports an intervention's
effectiveness, or a
finding of insufficient evidence suggests areas for future
research. For any finding,
thorough and transparent methodological reporting contributes to
the validity of the
systematic review, increasing its usefulness to public health
policy-makers and
professionals.","Section

The Role of Infant EEG, Mothers' Prenatal Anxiety and Parenting
Behaviors in the
Association Between Mothers' Perinatal Depression and Infant
Positive Affect
The present study sought to examine the relationship between
mothers' cumulative depression
symptom levels during the prenatal and postpartum periods and
infant positive affect (PA) at 3
and 6 months of age. Participants were 194 mothers with a history
of depression and/or anxiety
and their 3- and 6-month old infants. Mothers' depression symptom
levels were assessed during
the prenatal and postpartum periods using the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI). When the
infants were 3 and 6 months of age, mothers and their infants
visited the lab to complete a series
of videotaped segments. State PA was assessed using continuous
coding of affect exhibited
during the mother-infant free play interactions and trait PA was
measured using the
Surgency/Extraversion factor on the Infant Behavior
Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R). We tested
mediators for the relationship between mothers' depression and
infant PA: infant
electroencephalography (EEG) asymmetry scores and parenting quality
behaviors (ratings of
observed sensitivity/responsiveness, withdrawal and time spent in
PA). Mothers' postpartum
depression symptom levels for the first 3 months and first 6 months
postpartum were each
significantly negatively correlated with infant trait PA at 6
months ( r(159) = -.23, p &lt; .01; r(132)
= -.26, p &lt; .01), but were not significantly
associated with any of the other PA indices. Mothers'
prenatal symptom levels were not significantly associated with
infant PA at 3 or 6 months. Also,
neither infant EEG nor parenting quality mediated the association
between mothers' depression
symptoms during the first 6 months postpartum and infant trait PA
at 6 months. Mothers'
prenatal anxiety symptom levels, did not significantly predict
infant PA. Results suggest
mothers' cumulative postpartum depression symptom levels,
particularly during the first 3
months of the postpartum period, influence the temperament form of
infant PA at 6 months.
Future research should examine the PA trajectories of infants of
depressed mothers during the
first 6 months and beyond.","Table of Contents --

in Japanese Tegotomono","This thesis explores how the rising importance of the
Japanese koto in the
soukyoku-jiuta subgenre of
tegotomono led to a shift in overall musical texture from
homophony to instances of heterophony and polyphony within the
subgenre. This transformation is paralleled by the koto,
originally optional in the ensemble, becoming an indispensable
member of the tegotomono ensemble by the end of the Edo
period. Both the koto and shamisen have extensive,
celebrated repertoires in their respective genres of
soukyoku and
jiuta, but tegotomono brings the two together. This
combination of koto and shamisen was an unexpected
innovation, because the koto was a historically high-brow
instrument and the shamisen low-brow. Despite this
surprising collaboration, both instruments became indispensable
members of what is now considered the canon tegotomono
ensemble, and the subgenre displays influences from the repertoires
of both the koto and shamisen. Four representative
works of tegotomono are analyzed in this thesis to track the
shift in both musical texture and how the koto directly
relates to this change. Defining features in tegotomono that
depict this change include the koto creating a more complex
texture as its musical lines drift away from homophony,
increasingly elaborate compositions, and most importantly, motifs
akin to call-and-response called kake-ai.","List of Figures &amp; Tables -- A Note on the Japanese Language --

Prostitution Market in John Cleland's Fanny Hill","This thesis examines the theme of consumption as the driving
force behind the power structure present in John Cleland's Fanny
Hill. The market emerges as the primary site in which to engage
this theme. The analysis begins in the Covent Garden food market
with Mr. Norbert as this scene serves to most directly parallel the
food market with the prostitution market.
The first chapter explores consumption in its two major forms:
gastronomic and commercial. The text highlights gastronomic
consumption and how it operates to pit the woman as a consumable
object. To accomplish this, Cleland uses the direct presence of
food, the descriptive food language, the strategic placement of
meals in relation to sex scenes, and the duality of the table and
the mouth. These four uses of food emerge during Fanny's
interactions with her sexual partners, marking the power dynamic of
the consumer-consumed relationship. Following the discussion of
gastronomic consumption is the commercial consumption in the
prostitution market. Tracking Fanny's introduction, initiation, and
sale within the prostitution market portrays her as consumable
goods; ultimately, this demonstrates how her female marketers just
as readily consume her as her male clients.
The second chapter examines how Cleland uses the concept of
reverse consumption, the process by which the consumer becomes the
consumed, to reverse the previously established power structure.
Beginning with gastronomic consumption, the text looks at Cleland's
focus on the mouth and his depiction of the vagina as a
metaphorical, sexual mouth. By the physical positioning of the
prostitutes' bodies and their use of sex for their own pleasure,
Fanny and Louisa use reverse gastronomic consumption to assert
power over Will and the flower boy. The next section explores how
these two women pay the boys after sex, an action that denotes a
reverse commercial consumption whereby the prostitutes prostitute
the men.
Through highlighting the various forms of consumption and the
concept of reverse consumption, the text closely tracks Fanny's
development as a character, the question of whether or not Fanny
Hill serves as an example of female empowerment, and, more
broadly, the greater significance of studying food in
literature.","--  -- Table of Contents --

Infection and Humoral Immunity","Rotavirus (RV) infection is the leading cause of viral
gastroenteritis amongst children globally and is responsible for
upwards of 500,000 deaths annually. While 2 vaccines are available,
they do not adequately protect against disease amongst children in
developing countries. With this in mind, we aimed to determine if
environmental factors, specifically gut microbiota, contribute to
infection and induction of humoral responses. Using an infection
model, we found that microbiota-ablation, achieved through
antibiotic treatment or germ-free (GF) conditions, experienced a
delay in virus shedding. Postponed shedding correlated with less
virus at the small intestine, demonstrating that microbiota speeds
infection. Microbiota promoted RV entry as antibiotics had no
effect on replication. Antibiotics also protected against RV
diarrhea, demonstrating a negative role for microbiota during
disease. Microbiota inhibited humoral immunity as antibiotics
enhanced RV antibody production and small intestinal, IgA-producing
antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) frequencies. To examine if
microbiota exposure reversed the antibody-enhancing effects of
antibiotics, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was administered. DSS
increased inflammation and weakened RV antibody responses,
indicating that microbiota-derived inflammation inhibits humoral
immunity. Thus, the microbiota could be an environmental factor
involved in vaccine inefficacy and serve as a target for
therapeutics.
We also aimed to elucidate how innate immunity controls RV
infection and humoral immunity, as innate immunity to RV is
understudied. When mice lacking MyD88, an adaptor protein for most
TLRs and inflammasome cytokine receptors, were infected, they shed
more virus and experienced virus spread, demonstrating MyD88
controls infection and spread. Control of primary infection was
independent of inflammasome cytokines IL-1 and -18, indicating that
TLRs were responsible for limiting infection. MyD88-deficient
neonates experienced greater incidence of and days with diarrhea,
demonstrating that MyD88 protects against disease. Mice lacking
MyD88 also experienced slowed systemic antibody responses and
skewed IgG subisotype switching, with a bias towards Th2-associated
IgG1 and away from Th1-associated IgG2c. MyD88's influence on
antibody responses originated from bone marrow-derived MyD88, but
not epithelial MyD88, and IL-1 and -18 signaling prompted proper
subisotype switching. Insights into RV-specific innate immunity
uncovered novel therapeutic targets, including MyD88, TLRs, and
inflammasome cytokines, during RV infection and vaccination.","-- TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1 -- CHAPTER 2:

accessibility, or responsibility. Higher levels of maternal
depression during the first six weeks
postpartum were correlated with higher levels of father engagement
during the week. Higher
levels of maternal satisfaction with father responsibility and a
higher number of additional
children in the family were independently associated with higher
levels of father accessibility on
the weekends. Lastly, surgency/extraversion in the infants was
negatively correlated with
father accessibility on the weekends. This study, consistent with
Doherty and colleagues' (1998)
model, highlights the importance of using a multi-variable model to
examine predictors of

Premiums on Tobacco Cessation","This study attempted to determine if charging tobacco users more
for their health insurance premiums increases tobacco cessation
above predicted levels. A comparison of proportions test examined
the differences in tobacco cessation rates between a cohort who
were charged a tobacco surcharge and the predicted population
cessation rate. The Georgia State Health Benefit Plan (SHBP) began
charging a tobacco surcharge on monthly health insurance premiums
in July 2005. The surcharge was applied to each enrolled employee
who reported tobacco use during the past 12 months by the employee
or by any of the employee's covered dependents (spouse, dependent
children). A cohort of 43,034 SHBP members, who were state
employees, teachers, and school support staff, were followed for 70
months (July 2005 to April 2011). The Department of Community
Health (DCH) provided the raw data (non-identifiable to specific
individuals) used in this research. We found that over the 70
months observation period, 46.3% of the enrollees in the SHBP
cohort reported that all covered family members had quit using
tobacco, a figure that was significantly different than the 13.9%
that would have quit at the predicted national cessation rate.
Sensitivity analysis confirmed this finding when SHBP enrollees
quit in greater numbers when compared to a range of population
cessation rates. We concluded that charging tobacco users a higher
health insurance premium appears to significantly increase tobacco
cessation rates. This study measures self-reported cessation and
most likely overestimates the impact of the tobacco surcharge on
cessation, but sensitivity analysis indicates that the central
findings of this study hold true. This is the first study to employ
empirical data to examine the effect of charging higher health
insurance premiums to tobacco users and provides evidence that this
rapidly spreading practice may improve the public health by
increasing tobacco cessation.","Contents -- Introduction -- Literature Review --

Federal Funding Develop Capacity for the Prevention of
Healthcare-associated Infections?","Background
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) contribute to increased
morbidity, mortality and
healthcare costs in the United States and recently have gained
attention as a national public
health threat. A call to action has been issued by federal agencies
to encourage incentives,
research, surveillance, and the employment of evidence-based
practices to forward progress
towards the elimination of HAIs. Federal initiatives, including a
Department of Health and
Human Services action plan, Center for Medicare and Medicaid
Service pay for performance
incentives, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)
funding to state health
departments have supported an atmosphere of HAI awareness,
surveillance, and prevention. To
improve HAI prevention capacity, valid surveillance must be
conducted to monitor ongoing rates
and successes of prevention programs.

Methods
This project evaluates the HAI prevention capacity developed in the
first year of ARRA funding
at the state health department. Factor analysis is used to
determine state health department
characteristics before the receipt of ARRA funding that constitutes
baseline capacity for HAI
prevention. Descriptive statistics are used to quantify successes
and barriers for each of the three
targeted funding areas: Infrastructure, Surveillance, and
Prevention Collaboratives. Finally,
longitudinal mixed effects models are used to monitor state and
national trends in participation in
the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

Results
A factor analysis of capacity indicators extracted from state
funding application materials
revealed three distinct factors characterizing baseline HAI
prevention capacity: Human Capital
and Expertise, Campaigns and Trainings, and Collaborative Efforts.
States receiving ARRA
funding met programmatic goals in year one for all three targeted
funding areas; however, all
states reported barriers to implementation of activities.
Longitudinal modeling of NHSN
participation for facilities reporting CLABSIs in their ICUs in
states without reporting mandates
showed significant increases in rates of participation during the
ARRA time period for states
funded to improve surveillance capabilities.

Conclusions
Targeted federal funding appeared to successfully achieve
programmatic year one goals for the
development of state health department capacity for the prevention
of HAIs. Future work should
focus on continued programmatic success, as well as attempt to
quantify outcomes such as
infections prevented, deaths averted, and costs saved.","Table of Contents --

Guerrero: Use, Acceptability, and Appropriateness","Background: Un Kilo de Ayuda (UKA) is a non-governmental
organization that employs an integral nutrition intervention
consisting of six components, including food package distribution
and nutrition
education. Though the impact of the program as a whole has been
shown
with the program's own monitoring data, UKA has not conducted
evaluation of individual components to identify gaps between the
current results of
the program and the full potential of the program.
Objective: To evaluate use, acceptability, and
appropriateness of UKA's bimonthly
distributed food package at the household level.
Methods: In-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with two
staff members at the main
office of UKA in Mexico City, three site staff members at the
Guerrero site UKA center,
and 12 women receiving food packages from UKA. Observations were
conducted in six households for a total of 12-16
hours each. IDIs and observations were analyzed
using qualitative content analysis. A three-question survey
conducted by staff was
analyzed to assess which products mothers would remove from the
package if they could
exchange that product for another product.
Results: From the census, 20.8% of women said they would not
like to have any
products removed. Of women that said they would like to remove a
product from the
package, 43.1 said they would like to have flour removed, 13.1 said
they would like to
have amanene removed, and 11.6 said they would like to have
marzipan removed. All
reasons for not accepting these products were related to the
inability to purchase the
products in the region. Differences in main office staff and
beneficiary perceptions
existed for use of unaccepted products, acceptance of specific
products, and local
community norms affecting package use.
Discussion: There were few gaps in staff and beneficiary
perceptions of acceptance of
the package as a whole. However, broad gaps in main office staff
and beneficiary
perceptions of use, acceptance, and family distribution may limit
the effectiveness of the
package as a whole. The findings from this research can be used to
modify package
design as well as to illustrate the importance of strengthened
communication between
beneficiaries and main office staff.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1:

Involved In The Intracellular Transport of Mason-Pfizer Monkey
Virus","Real-time Visualization of Viral and Host Cell Proteins Involved
In The Intracellular Transport of Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus
By Jasmine Clark
Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus, the prototypic D-type retrovirus,
co-translationally assembles immature capsids in the pericentriolar
region of the cell. From here, immature capsids are transported to
the plasma membrane for budding, release, and maturation into an
infectious virions. Several mutational and biochemical studies have
been employed to elucidate viral and host proteins important for
this intracellular transport. Although these studies provided very
important insight as to what proteins are involved in this portion
of the viral life cycle, they have relied on population analysis of
capsids. In this dissertation, we create a codon-optimized M-PMV
Gag-eGFP fusion vector with an optimized Kozak consensus sequence
and an alanine substitution at an internal methionine. This vector,
co-expressed with untagged Gag, produces fluorescently-labeled
capsids that are able to be visualized by real-time, live cell
imaging. Characterization of the trafficking of these fluorescent
capsids implicated a role for microtubules. This role was confirmed
by employing the use of cytoskeletal inhibitors. Furthermore, using
a mCherry-tagged M-PMV Env, co-transport of M-PMV Gag and Env was
observed, and this co-transport as well as incorporation of Env
into released virions required the presence of intact microtubules.
This data provides strong support for the hypothesis that in order
to produce infectious virus, M-PMV Env that has been transported to
the plasma membrane from the trans Golgi network is endocytosed and
recycled through the pericentriolar region, whereby these
Env-containing recycling vesicles interact with assembled immature
capsids, followed by co-transport, along microtubules, toward the
plasma membrane for budding.","Table of Contents -- Abstract -- Dedication -- Acknowledgements --

Former Yugoslavia","ABSTRACT
The success of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia (ICTY)
relies on the cooperation of national states. Former Yugoslav
compliance with the ICTY remains
underexplored in international law and international justice
scholarship. Seldom is the question
asked: why do states comply with international criminal
tribunals?
I will attempt to discern motivations behind state actions and
identify the causal
phenomenon behind compliance and non-compliance by examining former
Yugoslav
compliance with ICTY indictment orders between 1994 and 2011.
International relations
literature has identified competing explanations that range from
rationalist arguments focusing
on third party coercion and material self-interests, to normative
legitimization of rules
arguments. This study seeks to understand why states comply with
international tribunals by
examining: (1) individual specific characteristics, (2) domestic
factors (economic and political)
and (3) international pressures. Using survival analysis, I find
that all three of the aforementioned
factors affect the timing of extradition. This study finds that the
domestic audience is extremely
unfavorable towards cooperation. Even so, this study supports
rationalist arguments and finds
that the prospect of accession into the European Union correlates
with more rapid extraditions.
However, this study does not find support for the normative
arguments which claim that an
internalization of human rights laws will lead to
cooperation.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

published,emory:bcpcp,"Edwards, Lindsay J","T cell recognition of weak ligands activates negative regulatory
pathways","The outcomes of T cell interaction with antigen are determined
by a complex integration
of positive and negative signaling events downstream of the T cell
receptor. The
introduction of amino acid substitutions into the antigenic peptide
provide an opportunity
to alter T cell activation by modulating the affinity of the T cell
receptor for the peptide:
MHC complex or by altering the stability of the peptide: MHC
interaction itself. Both of
these strategies can generate ligands that drive atypical T cell
activation by stimulating
negative regulatory pathways, which we demonstrate with an
antagonist in a model
antigen system, an MHC variant peptide in a type 1 diabetes system
and a myelin antigen
in an in vivo model of multiple sclerosis. The effects of these
weak ligands are evident as
both antagonism and MHC variant peptide treatment induce a stable
hypoproliferative
phenotype. These two stimulations differ somewhat in their outcomes
as antagonism
drives a response in which IL-2 is highly produced, whereas the MHC
variant peptide
stimulates a classic anergic phenotype is which the T cells fail to
produce IL-2 in
response to an agonist ligand. Both antagonism and this form of
anergy have been shown
to rely on the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. As self antigens are
generally thought to be
relatively weak ligands, we sought to determine the effects of
SHP-1 deficiency on the
autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
Despite data
that SHP-1 is a negative regulator of T cell activation, we found
that deletion in T cells
decreased both the incidence and severity of EAE. This effect
appears to depend upon
the presence of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells, as depletion of these cells
resulted in disease
severity similar to that of control groups. These results suggest
that the function of SHP-
1 in T cell biology is more complex than simple negative regulation
of activation, and
that the consequences of SHP-1 activation may vary between subsets
of T cells.
Collectively, our data demonstrate that T cell stimulation by both
weak ligands and self
antigens can drive the activation of negative regulatory pathways,
thus leading to a
continuum of functional responses.","-- Table of Contents -- Chapter 1

published,emory:pg26p,"Oswald, William Edward","Predictors and effects of community sanitation for control of
Neglected Tropical Diseases in Amhara Region, Ethiopia","Sanitation, or safe disposal of human excreta, is fundamental to
a hygienic living environment and to public health. Neglected
Tropical Diseases, like trachoma and soil-transmitted helminth
(STH) infections, occur under unhygienic conditions and
predominantly affect children. Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from low
levels of sanitation access, and heterogeneity in sanitation access
also exists within countries in this area. Few studies have
examined the relationship between these diseases and sanitation
access as a community measure or reasons for geographic
heterogeneity in community sanitation. This dissertation examined
these questions using data combined from five surveys conducted
across Amhara Region, Ethiopia between 2011-2014 by the Amhara
Regional Health Bureau and The Carter Center's Trachoma Control
Program.

The first two studies aimed to estimate the effect of community
sanitation on prevalence among children of active trachoma and
infection with three STH (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris
trichiura, hookworm). Multilevel analyses were conducted using
generalized linear mixed models, accounting for complex survey
design. The first study found that increased community sanitation
was associated with decreased prevalence odds of active trachoma
among children, aged 1 to 9 years, following 5 years of
trachoma-control activities. The second study found no evidence of
a protective association of increased community sanitation with
prevalence of STH infection among children, aged 6 to 15 years.
Hookworm prevalence was not associated with community sanitation.
T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides prevalence was
higher in communities with higher sanitation. Association of
community sanitation with A. lumbricoides prevalence
depended on household sanitation.

The third study aimed to develop and validate a model to predict
low community sanitation. Logistic regression was used with
remote-sensing and other data on environmental and social
conditions. The selected model predicted low community sanitation
with reasonable discrimination and was used to generate a risk map
of poor community sanitation for Amhara Region.

These studies demonstrate the need for increased community
sanitation to reduce trachoma prevalence and further research to
clarify the role of community sanitation in preventing STH
infections. Predictive modeling using environmental and social
conditions can assist health and sanitation programs to identify
areas that need additional or alternate sanitation

fluorination with NFSI, followed by nucleobase coupling under

were inactive in cell-based assays. While this result may indicate
that the corresponding nucleoside triphosphates are not effective
inhibitors of the viral polymerases, it may also be the case that
the nucleosides are not converted to the triphosphates due to a
lack of recognition by cellular kinases. Therefore, nucleoside
triphosphates were evaluated in cell-free assays, revealing a clear
structure-activity relationship. These results indicate that while
a 2'-fluoro substituent is an effective isostere for the 2'-hydroxy
moiety, removal of the 3'-hydroxy group leads to loss of activity
against viral polymerases.
Part II of this dissertation describes efforts toward the
synthesis of cyclobutyl nucleoside phosphonate and phosphonamidate
prodrugs. The nucleoside analogs were synthesized via formal
[3+1] cycloaddition of protected 1,3-dibromo-2-propanol and methyl
methylthiomethyl sulfoxide and subsequent nucleobase coupling under
SN2 conditions. Various conditions were screened for
preparation of the lipophilic phosphonate prodrug. This compound
was ultimately prepared via phosphonodichloridate

anti-HIV activity of several novel four-membered ring nucleoside
and nucleotide analogs as anti-HIV agents. The synthesis of these
analogs features a [2+2] cycloaddition or [3+1] cycloaddition to
construct the carbocyclic four-membered ring or thietane ring. An
efficient SN2 strategy was used to couple the
carbocyclic four-membered ring with a variety of nucleoside bases,
including pyrimidine and purine bases. In addition, the
Pummerer-type rearrangement was used to synthesize the thietanose
nucleosides. The EC50 values of those compounds in human
PBM cell lines ranged from 14.6 to 100 μM and some of them
were shown toxicity in PBM, CEM and Vero cells. Interestingly, most
of the cyclobutyl nucleoside analogs did not show any anti-HIV
activity; however, some of the cyclobutyl phosphonate nucleoside
analogs did show some mild anti-HIV activity and toxicity. For the
thietanose nucleosides, some of them showed moderate activity and
cytotoxicity. The other nucleosides showed neither anti-HIV
activity nor cytotoxicity up to 100 μM.

published,emory:19mqd,"Aubert, Rachael D","Interplay between T and B cell responses during chronic viral
infection","The adaptive immune response has evolved multiple mechanisms for
protection against invading pathogens. CD8 T cells mediate
protection against intracellular pathogens by killing infected
cells, whereas the B cell response provides antibody that can
neutralize foreign pathogens. Additionally, CD4 T cell responses
are important for activating CD8 T cell and B cell responses.
Although the importance of CD4 T cells in initiating B cell
responses is well established, less is understood about how CD4 T
cells initiate or sustain CD8 T cell responses. This question
becomes increasingly important as we try to understand why CD8 T
cell responses fail during chronic viral infections such as HIV,
HBV and HCV. In these infections, a poor CD4 T cell response is
often associated with functional exhaustion of the CD8 T cells. To
better understand the interplay between CD4 T cell responses and
CD8 T cell exhaustion, we examined the effects of altering CD4 T
cell and B cell responses during chronic LCMV infection of mice. We
first examined the question of how transient removal of CD4 T cell
help affects long-term CD8 T cell responses. Secondly, we
determined whether improving CD4 T cell help would affect CD8 T
cell exhaustion. A transient one-week blockade of CD4 T cell help
via administration of αCD40L blocking antibody beginning at
two weeks post infection had no direct effect on the function of
CD8 T cells but resulted in reduced CD4 T cell function and
decreased levels of humoral immunity. This decreased CD4 T cell
response then resulted in greater CD8 T cell exhaustion and
impaired viral clearance. On the other hand, adoptive transfer of
virus specific CD4 T cells during chronic LCMV infection restored
function in exhausted CD8 T cells and also enhanced antibody
responses. This rescue was observed for several CD8 T cell
epitopes, was synergized by αPD-L1 treatment, and resulted in
improved viral control in treated animals. Thus, these studies
provide insights into how CD4 T cells and B cells can affect CD8 T
cell programming and how one might design therapies to combat
chronic infections in humans.","Table of Contents -- Table of Contents -- List of Figures -- Table

Opportunities for Improving Maternal Nutrition in Bihar, India","Introduction: Maternal underweight and anemia are serious
problems in Bihar and are
important factors in the persistence of high levels of child
undernutrition. Although
numerous programs and platforms exist for delivering effective
interventions for
improving maternal nutrition, the coverage and quality of these
interventions is low and
they are not achieving the desired results.
Objective: This study aimed to assess the status of
effective interventions for improving
maternal nutrition in Bihar and to identify barriers and
opportunities for expanding
coverage and quality.
Methods: Forty-eight key informant interviews were
conducted with policy makers,
program managers and service providers in Bihar at state, district,
block and facility
levels. Secondary data was collected from survey reports and
program documents. All
data was analyzed thematically.
Results: Numerous barriers impede the delivery of
effective interventions for improving
maternal nutrition in Bihar. Implementation level barriers include
the shortage of human
resources; an inadequate supply of basic equipment and supplies;
and low recognition of
the magnitude and consequences of maternal undernutrition. Policy
level barriers include
low prioritization of maternal nutrition and the lack of emphasis
on delaying and spacing
births. Societal barriers include poverty, gender inequality and
caste-based
discrimination. Innovations for improving program delivery include
household mapping
and microplanning; cash incentives for meeting targets; and
electronic fund transfer
systems. Potential platforms for delivering interventions include
Panvjayati Raj
Institutions, women's Self-Help Groups, and programs to educate and
empower
adolescent girls.
Discussion: Significant progress has been made in recent
years by the new Government
of Bihar to expand the coverage and quality of public health
services throughout the state.
However, due to years of neglect under previous governments, much
remains to be done.
Recommendations for strengthening the delivery of interventions to
improve maternal
and birth outcomes include setting targets in program
implementation plans, increasing
outreach to adolescent girls and women outside of pregnancy,
strengthening field
supervision, empowering women and increasing the involvement of
community-based
organizations. Recommendations will be shared with the Government
of Bihar and its
partners to assist them in their efforts to improve maternal and
child health.","Table of Contents -- 1. Introduction. 1 -- 1.1.

Diagnosis","Introduction:Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects an estimated
6.4 million school-aged youth. Many clinicians rely on the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) for an
ADHD diagnosis. As the diagnosis of ADHD relies on a set of
subjective responses to assess objective criteria, ADHD remains
complicated to diagnose. As a result, DSM has undergone numerous
revisions, the most recent which maintains the symptom and
impairment criteria, but drops the multi-axial system which
previously suggested a global assessment of functioning for a
diagnosis. The goal of this paper is to perform an exploratory
factor analysis to investigate the factors of impairment associated
with ADHD and the four most common co-occurring mental disorders
(generalized anxiety, major depression, CD and ODD) and determine
whether a composite scale of impairment would be more valid when
assessing the impairment criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD.
Methods: An exploratory factor analysis was performed on
the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV)
impairment questions related to ADHD-I, ADHD-H, generalized
anxiety, major depression, CD and ODD. Subsequently, a sensitivity
analysis was performed to determine the validity of the results by
adding a random uniform deviate to create 10 new datasets, and
performing ten additional exploratory factor analyses. Empirical
95% confidence intervals of the Cronbach's alpha values for all of
the datasets were computed to determine the reliability of the
initial results.
Results: The results of the factor analysis illustrated
that the factors generally grouped together by condition as there
were two ADHD factors, one CD factor, one GA factor, one MD factor
and one ODD factor. The results of the sensitivity analysis yielded
a mean Cronbach alpha greater than 0.70 for each of the factors,
illustrating a reliable scale.
Discussion: The results of this analysis demonstrate the
validity of relying on condition-specific criteria for the
diagnosis of ADHD, as the factors grouped by condition. These
results also support the revision of the DSM criteria from the
multi-axial system, suggesting that the multi-axial system may not
increase the validity of the diagnosis of certain conditions.","--  --  -- 1.

If She Says Yes or Is Silent: A New Interpretation of Female
Marital Consent in the
Settlement Period in Iceland as Revealed Through the Family
Sagas
By Jill M. Fortney
This thesis seeks to explain how female marital consent functioned
in Saga-Age
(870 ­ 1050) Iceland by examining the Family Sagas and the Law
Code. It is in part a
response to the work of another scholar, Jenny Jochens and her book
Women in Old
Norse Society. Jochens believes that female marital consent did not
exist in Iceland
during the Saga Age and that any mention of it in the Sagas is a
Christian interpolation

Nox1 meditated Reactive Oxygen Species Induce Oxidation of 14-3-3
cysteine residues in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells
By Zoila Isabel Fernadez
Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is important during
vascular development and contributes to vascular lesion formation.
It plays a role in diseases such as atherosclerosis and
postangioplasty restenosis. The mechanism regulating migration of
this cell type are therefore of great interest. Recent work in our
laboratory has shown that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
induces VSMC migration by activating the cofilin phosphatase
slingshot (SSH1L) via a reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated
mechanism. The exact mechanism of SSH1L activation, however, is not
completely understood. Previous studies have revealed that SSH1L is
associated with 14-3-3 proteins in an inhibitory complex that is
disrupted serine 834 within 14-3-3 binding motif in SSH1L regulates
its binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Interestingly, we describe that the
phosphatase responsible for the Serine 834 dephosphorylation and
therefore phosphatase activation is SSH1L itself through a
mechanism that required Nox1-based NAPDH oxidase. In addition, we
established that Nox1-mediated 14-3-3 oxidation of cysteine
residues leads to an initial SSH1L/14-3-3 complex disruption that
allowed SSH1L autodephosphorylation to occur. Because of the key
role of 14-3-3 oxidation, we generated cysteine mutants to identify
the redox sensitive sites in 14-3-3 that affect its binding
capacity.","Table of Contents -- Introduction

Effects of High Frequency Electrical Stimulation of the Infralimbic
Cortex on Cellular
Activity in the Rodent Brain
By Ashwin G. Ramayya
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subgenual cingulate (Cg25)
white matter
(WM) is a novel surgical therapy which has recently been used to
treat severely
depressed, treatment-resistant individuals. While it has shown
significant therapeutic
effects, the mechanism by which DBS achieves clinical benefits is
not completely
understood. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that Cg25WM
DBS leads to a
suppression of metabolic activity in the Cg25, which is a known
mediator of negative
mood. In this study, we aimed to gain some understanding of how
this occurs by studying
the effects of acute high frequency stimulation (HFS) on cellular
activity in the rodent
brain. We targeted the infralimbic cortex (IL), the rodent
homologue of Cg25, and
quantified cellular activity by measuring the density of cells
expressing c-fos, an
Immediate Early Gene (IEG) which is expressed in the nucleus of
active cells. We
compared cellular activity in stimulated and non-stimulated rats
locally in the IL, in the
monosynaptically connected basomedial amygdala (BMA) and the
polysynaptically
connected hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). We found there to be a
greater cellular
activity in all three regions of the stimulated brain, suggesting
that Cg25WM DBS has
far-reaching acute effects on cellular activity. The increased
cellular activity in the IL was
found to be statistically significant; however, there were not
enough subjects to
conclusively determine the significance of increased cellular
activity in the BMA and the
DG.

","Energetic Contribution of Amyloid Self-assembly
By
Yan Liang
Controlling pathways that distinguish protein folding from
misfolding is critical to
viability as highlighted by the nearly 40 protein misfolding
diseases. The correlated
interactions between amino acid side chains and the backbone have
been implicated in
protein -structural assembly and stability, yet the relative
contributions have been
difficult to evaluate directly. In this dissertation, the central
core sequence of the A
peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease, A(16-22), was
developed as an
experimental system for evaluating these interactions. Factors
which contribute to the
hydrophobic core interactions, such as side chain cross-strand
pairing along the -sheet
surface, buried solvent accessible surface area in forming an
amyloid structure, and the
side chain conformational entropy, were shown to determine the
characteristic amyloid
cross- structure. The assembly of the A(16-22) model system
indicates that a
desolvation step occurs during amyloid nucleation. By direct
real-time imaging, peptides
that give rise to amyloid assemblies undergo hydrophobic collapse
to large micron size
aggregates which maintain the properties of molten globules.
Further, the amyloid growth
is nucleated within these dynamic unstructured aggregates; and once
the nuclei are
formed, the amyloid assembly grows via monomer addition to the
highly ordered
amyloid ends. These results provide a direct real-time observation
of amyloid assemblies,
and suggest that therapeutic intervention should focus on cell
type-specific surfaces able
to template the nucleation of cytotoxic amyloid. In addition,
taking advantage of the
amyloid cross- scaffold, a pigment array has been constructed
within a paracrystalline
amyloid nanotube and Förster energy transfer along the
nanotube surface has been
demonstrated to self-assembled acceptor dyes, which promises the
potential application
of using amyloid structures to generate light harvesting
antenna.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CHAPTER 1 MECHANISM OF AMYLOID SELF-ASSEMBLY

published,emory:845r3,"Boyle, Margaret Elizabeth","Bad Girls on Stage: Spectacles of Deviance and Rehabilitation in
Early Modern Spain","Bad Girls on Stage explores the interdependent
relationships among public theater, custodial institutions and
women in early modern Spain. I argue that the bad girl is not
merely a stock figure but rather that she dramatizes significant
and controversial issues for the period: the rapidly changing role
of women and the increased bureaucracy of the new urban
centers.
This study begins by asking how custodial institutions were
shaped by their interdependent economic relationship with public
theater. To address this question, Chapter 1 focuses on Madrid's
la casa de Santa María Magdalena de la Penitencia
(founded 1587) and la galera (founded 1604). Through
the study of institutional manuals and legal documents, the chapter
compares the spectacular rehabilitation strategies employed by
these institutions. Subsequent chapters move the project from the
historical to the theatrical realm: concentrating on the popular
staging of the early modern widow, female community and the
murderess, supplementing institutional accounts of women's
rehabilitation with popular accounts from the public theater.
Chapter 2 focuses on the widowed protagonist of Pedro
Calderón de la Barca's La dama duende (1629) and her
escapade through two important settings: the enclosure of the
domestic sphere and Madrid's burgeoning city streets. Chapter 3
addresses the interplay between female community, a heroine's
betrayal, and the comedia as an instructive tool in
María de Zayas' La traición en la amistad (1630).
Chapter 4 examines Luis Vélez de Guevara's La serrana de la
Vera (1613), exploring the ways in which moralizing effects are
achieved through the display of the protagonist's violence,
enacted, not insignificantly, by one of the most prominent
actresses of his generation, Jusepa Vaca.
Bad Girls on Stage puts into dialogue scenes of
rehabilitation crafted by early modern Spanish dramatists with
those enacted by contemporary custodial institutions. Although
historical evidence shows these two spheres were likely already
informed by one another throughout the early modern period, this
project takes significant steps to document their
interrelationship, especially as it illuminates the obscured
history of gender-specific rehabilitation.",

Role of Hydrogen Peroxide in the Development of Abdominal Aortic
Aneurysms
By John Brian Clark
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are a significant health problem
in the United
States and abroad. In men over the age of 55 it is estimated that
the prevalence is between 5-
9%. AAA rupture leads to thousands of deaths each year and is a
leading cause of death in
older men. Despite the significant clinical endpoints, very little
is known about the initial
events leading to the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
The hallmarks of AAA
are aortic diameters &gt;50% normal, chronic inflammation of the
abdominal aorta, matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and elastin fragmentation. Many
studies suggest a
critical role for reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in
AAA development. The
central hypothesis of this thesis is that a particular reactive
oxygen species, hydrogen
peroxide, plays a critical role in the development of AAA. To test
this hypothesis we utilized
several different murine models of AAA, ultrasound imaging to
monitor aortic dilation, and
Amplex Red to measure relative levels of hydrogen peroxide. Herein,
we demonstrate that
increases in hydrogen peroxide levels may be model dependent and
commercially available
antioxidant therapies fail to significantly lower hydrogen peroxide
levels and have no effect
on AAA development.

Program delivery and user's
perceptions in Guerrero, Mexico
By Corey McAuliffe

Background: Worldwide there are few comprehensive nutrition
programs that resemble
Un Kilo de Ayuda's (UKA) structure and objectives. UKA is an
influential non-
governmental nutrition organization working within states of Mexico
identified as having
high levels of undernutrition in children less than five years of
age and pregnant women.
UKA's vision is to eradicate child malnutrition in Mexico by the
year 2023 through
incorporating community, company, and state government
relationships to support their
comprehensive nutrition program. According to staff, nutrition
education is considered to
be the most important and critical organizational action. The
organization recognizes a
high turnover rate of health promoters and staff within their
attention centers, in addition
to a relatively high variability of community participation within
specific communities.

Objective: To capture the adequacy of program delivery; user
perceptions; document
programmatic successes, challenges, and barriers; in order to
provide recommendations
for future activities.

Methods: We conducted a qualitative and quantitative review of
UKA's nutrition
education component in Guerrero, Mexico through: collection and
review of component
materials; observation and assessment of nutrition education
sessions; in-depth interviews
with all levels of staff; focus group discussions with community
participants; and
community surveys.

Results: Key themes impacting optimal delivery of the program
included: (1)
prioritization of other program actions over nutrition education;
(2) low levels of job
satisfaction and confidence as reported by Health Promoters; (3)
ability of Health
Promoters to bridge the disconnect between headquarters'
perceptions and actual
community needs; and (4) reported barriers to increased
participation in sessions.

Discussion: UKA's nutrition education component has the
potential to affect behavior
change and empower women to make healthy and nutritious decisions
regarding their
own well-being and that of their family. In order to make this a
reality, foundational
restructuring and prioritization of components, increased support
and communication
between headquarters and attention center staff, and interventions
focused on community
needs and desires must be addressed in order to achieve a
successful nutrition education
component.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Introduction: 1 -- Introduction: 1

Enteric Nervous System Development","Endothelin-3 (EDN3) and its obligate receptor endothelin
receptor B (EDNRB) are thought to play an essential role in enteric
nervous system (ENS) development by regulating the proliferation
and differentiation of enteric neural crest cells and their
precursors. Patients with pediatric condition Hirschsprung disease
(HSCR), a congenital ENS disorder, have been identified with a
missense point mutation in the human EDNRB gene. To confirm the
evolutionary conservation for the requirement of Endothelin-3
signaling in ENS development, we have identified and cloned two
EDNRB orthologues in zebrafish. Bioinformatics analysis has
revealed that the second copy of EDNRB gene has arisen because of
the hypothesized genome duplication that occurred in teleosts after
they diverged from the other vertebrate lineages. Subsequently,
antisense digoxigenin-labeled probes were generated to characterize
the expression pattern of EDNRB orthologues during embryogenesis.
We found that both EDNRB1a and EDNRB1b orthologues are expressed in
the neural crest precursors as these cells begin to enter the
gastrointestinal tract and migrate caudally along its length. These
results support our hypothesis that there is a conserved function
of EDNRB orthologues in neural crest migration and ENS development
in zebrafish model system.","Introduction

published,emory:pjpmb,"Moriarty, Hannah Kathryn","The Artistic Vision of the Androgynous Female: An Exploration of
Patterned Symbolism and Gender Constructs in the Lifework of
Virginia Woolf","Throughout her novels, Virginia Woolf maintains a constant
awareness of normative gender roles and the means by which
masculine and feminine identities fit within these societal
conventions. One means by which Woolf repeatedly returns the
reader's attention to these pervasive gendered identities is
through her patterned and cross-textual use of imagery. In
particular, I have chosen to trace the presence of, and explore the
language surrounding, the seemingly banal objects of the tree and
the table. The analysis of their function within the text will shed
insight into this dilemma of a gendered binary that our female
creator Virginia Woolf faced in the writing of her masterpieces
Orlando, To the Lighthouse, and Between the Acts. I
will detail the way in which the perceived legacy of males and
females is inherently different and the means by which, in each of
her three novels, Woolf entertains a similar figure of female
androgyny in order to mediate this tension between the gender
binary. Woolf advocates for a world in which women can venture
outside of their traditionally defined sphere of domesticity and
illuminates the voice of female intuition that has previously been
silenced. She questions: What voice has society deprived from the
male-dominated sphere of academia? What can the women bring to the
table? I propose that the androgynous female creators Orlando the
poet, Lily Briscoe the painter, and Miss La Trobe the playwright,
will embody not only this tension between the binary but also
illuminate a liminal space in which a meeting of the minds can
occur, a means to attain the hallowed ""man-womanly"" or
""woman-manly"" mindset that Woolf sets forth in A Room of One's
Own.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CHAPTER 1: Traditions of Knowledge 1 --

Type and Purchasing Practices of Adolescent Consumers","Introduction: There are many types of sugars
consumed by individuals living in the United States, and the
consumption patterns of these different sugars is not known. The
purpose of the first study in this thesis is to estimate the amount
of each type of sugar consumed among demographic groups: age,
gender, income, and race or ethnicity The purpose of the second
study is to understand where sugar-containing foods and beverages
are purchased and consumed by adolescents.
Data/Methods: For the first study, nationally
representativeNHANES data from the combined 09-10 and 11-12 cycles
were used to describe sugar intake among different demographic
groups. For the second study, NHANES data from the 2011-2012 cycle
were used to estimate sugar content of foods and beverages consumed
by adolescents aged 12 to 19 years (n=1152) based on purchase
location. For both studies, food codes were categorized as dairy or
non-dairy and as food or beverage according to the Food and
Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) codes. Added sugar
values were acquired from the Food Patterns Equivalence Database to
determine content of added and natural sugars in each dairy,
non-dairy, food, and beverage group were calculated for both
studies.
Results: Among all age groups, adolescents aged 12-19
years consumed the most added sugars from all sources at 91.4 (95%
CI 87.0, 95.7) grams each day. More than half of this added sugar
comes from non-dairy beverages at 47.2 (95% CI 43.1, 51.4) grams.
The average amount of added sugar in a non-dairy beverage from a
restaurant with a server is 51.4 (95% CI 45.0, 57.8) grams of added
sugar, versus the next-highest amount from convenience stores of
42.7 (95% CI 34.6, 50.8).
Discussion/Conclusion: Consumption of
sugars peaks in adolescence, particularly of added sugars in
non-dairy beverages; as such, efforts to reduce consumption of
added sugars should focus on adolescents. Large differences are
seen in average sugar content by purchase locations, such as the
sugar content of beverages purchased at restaurants compared to
other purchase locations. There is a need to determine what causes
these differences in sugar intake among adolescents and sugar
content from different locations.","Chapter 1:

Valve","One of the most common congenital heart defects is
bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), occurring in about 1% to 2% of the
population. In patients with BAV the aortic valve deviates from
normal in that it only has two leaflets instead of three. BAV can
result in altered hemodynamics and decreased performance of the
valve, which in turn can lead to serious complications, such as
aortic dilation, stenosis, regurgitation, aneurysms, dissection and
infective endocarditis. This research focuses on understanding the
pathology behind one complication associated with bicuspid aortic
valves in particular: aortic dilation . This is
primarily because aortic dilation is correlated to greatly
increased risk for further complications such as aortic
regurgitation, formation of an aortic aneurysm or aortic
dissection.
The framework to which the present work belongs is a project for
investigating the fluid dynamics in the ascending aorta of patients
with BAV in order to reveal the hemodynamic mechanisms possibly
causing aortic dilation in some patients and not others.
Differences in BAV morphologies due to the fusion of different
combinations of cusps and different inlet sizes were considered,
and an idealized geometry of the aorta was used. This investigation
was conducted via three-dimensional computational models that are
able to provide reliable evaluation of various hemodynamic and
anatomical parameters, relevant for prediction and quantification
of aortic dilation.
It was found that as the size of the inlet decreases, the
velocity, pressure and wall shear stress all increase in the
ascending aorta. Blood vessel wall remodeling is associated with
prolonged increases of pressure and flow rate, and so narrow inlets
may be correlated with aortic dilation. It is unclear how the
fusion of different leaflets is correlated with pathologies of the
aortic arch, but when coupled with a small inlet, rotated inlets
induce asymmetry of the blood flow. At this point in the research
it can be concluded that there is something inherent with blood
flow in the aortic arch in models with bicuspid aortic valves that
is intrinsically different from the normal tricuspid aortic valve
flow. Additionally, this flow differs depending on the specific
morphology of the bicuspid aortic valve under investigation.","CONTENTS -- 1. Introduction

Through Plato's Philebus","Abstract
Pleasure and the Absence of Pain:
Reading Epicurus' Hedonism Through Plato's Philebus
By Kelly E. Arenson
Epicurus made a name for himself in the ancient world when he
identified
pleasure with the absence of pain and proceeded to distinguish it
from a second,
seemingly different variety of pleasure--that found `in motion'
(kinetic). I interpret
Epicurus' distinction through the lens of Plato's Philebus
and the ancient debates
concerning that dialogue. At issue in these debates and the
theories that arise from them
is whether pleasure is a process or an end and how pleasure ought
to be conceived in
terms of the harmonious functioning of a living organism. I argue
that Plato identifies
pleasure with the perceived process of restoration of an organism's
natural harmony and
that he uses this description to deny that pleasure is the good.
Aristotle, rebuking the
Platonic position, counters that pleasures are not processes of
replenishment but are
associated with the activity of an organism's unimpeded
functioning. In the Epicurean
development of these ideas, kinetic pleasure is the perceived
restoration of the natural
functioning of a living organism, and katastematic pleasure is
painless, natural
functioning itself, or health. On this reading, Epicurus considers
any perceived affection
that does not involve pain to be katastematic and thus the highest
pleasure, including
everyday sensory pleasures, such as taste. I show that Epicurus'
distinction between
pleasures serves as a dialectical response to the Philebus
and bears the marks of
Aristotle's response to the dialogue as well.","CONTENTS -- ABBREVIATIONS -- NOTES ON THE TEXT -- INTRODUCTION 1 --

Less common, however, are studies that examine the consequences of status and power processes where women hold a higher occupational status and more power than men. I address this limitation by examining perceptions of work roles made by teachers and custodians in an elementary school. Although teachers are expected to have a higher status in relation to custodians, their dependency upon them to maintain and clean the school may allow custodians to have more power over teachers in some of their interactions. To address this unique context, I analyze 26 semi-structured interviews of teachers and custodians working in a school district in the Northeast. The interviews reveal that teachers hesitate to recognize the lower status of custodians in the school and instead characterize their work environment more as a community than as a hierarchy. Custodians, on the other hand, indicate their lower status by referencing instances of blame they receive for items that go missing or for tasks that are inadequately fulfilled, disrespect, and through the identity work they perform. In spite of their lower status in the school, however, the nature of custodial duties fosters the dependence of teachers on custodians and enables custodians to possess more power over their individual interactions with teachers. This greater power is evidenced by ways custodians resist the requests of teachers and how teachers attempt to lessen their dependence. Implications for the operation of gender in influencing how teachers and custodians perceive their relative status and power are discussed.","I. Introduction.....1

published,emory:pjssb,"Kim, Young Joo",A Study of Mythological Figures in Catacomb Art,"Catacombs were built in Rome in the second century first
when there was a need for more burial space. Along with the
preexisting columbaria, catacombs served as mass burial
systems for both Christians and non-Christians in Rome. Although
catacombs were eventually out of burial use, they were still
integrated by church and became Christianized monuments. Therefore
catacomb art is generally considered as Christian art. The presence
of mythological figures such as Orpheus, Hercules, and Sol Invictus
can be observed in catacomb art before and after the Edict of Milan
in 313 A.D. The mythological figures likely represent Christ or
reflect the virtues of Christ, namely His divinity and humanity.
The presence of mythological figures in catacomb art indicates
visual syncretism of Christianity and traditional religions in
Rome. The relationship between the image of Christ and His identity
in Rome can be observed by studying the imageries in catacomb
art.","Introduction (pp. 1-2) -- Catacomb Paintings (pp. 2-6) -- 1.

Addressing the HIV/AIDS Epidemic among African American Women","There is an increasingly urgent need to develop effective and
sustainable
interventions that can curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic among African
American women in
the US. In this project I analyze the underlying conceptions of
identity and social
structure that many public health researchers draw on when
theorizing about the causes
of and interventions for African American women's high HIV
transmission rate. Utilizing
Chandra Talpade Mohanty's theory of identity production through
local power systems, I
suggest that monolithic understandings of African American women's
identity limit
epidemiological research by obscuring how particular African
American women's
identities are constructed through social forces and how this
identity development
contributes to HIV transmission. Furthermore, drawing on Michel
Foucault's formulation
of power, I argue that thinking about contextual forces (e.g.,
social structure and culture)
as all-powerful arrangements limits public health interventions to
two general
approaches: 1) abstract social change or 2) limited, individualized
behavior modification.
I propose that Mohanty and Foucault's theories offer a useful
conceptual framework for
envisioning how tangible structural interventions can generate
lasting health benefits.
Moreover, I suggest that Foucault's conception of power offers a
model for designing
structural interventions based on an understanding of positive
deviance (PD). This theory
states that within any community plagued by a particular disease
there is always a subset
of at-risk individuals who remain healthy by engaging in particular
kinds of behaviors. I
conclude by exploring how a systems approach to PD research can
unearth effective
strategies for reducing the disparate rate of HIV infection among
African American
women.","Table of Contents -- Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

published,emory:7qnd9,"Wortham, Tesheka ","Molecular genetic analysis of unc-94 and unc-100,
two genes that are important for normal myofibril organization in
C. elegans","Sarcomeres, highly ordered assemblages of several hundred
proteins, perform the work of muscle contraction. Despite
increasing knowledge of sarcomeric proteins and their functions, we
lack a clear understanding about how sarcomeres are assembled and
maintained. We study this question in the model organism, C.
elegans. My studies focused on phenotypically characterizing
and molecularly identifying two genes that are important for normal
sarcomere assembly and maintenance: unc-94 and
unc-100.
Along with the original allele of unc-94, su177,
I have recovered and characterized a new allele, sf20. In
unc-94 mutants, immunofluorescence microscopy shows that a
number of known sarcomeric proteins are abnormal, but the most
dramatic effect is in the localization of F-actin, with some,
abnormally accumulated near muscle cell-to-cell boundaries. EM
shows that unc-94(sf20) mutants have large accumulations of
thin filaments near the boundaries of adjacent muscle cells. I have
proven that unc-94 encodes a tropomodulin, a conserved
protein known to cap the pointed ends of thin filaments.
su177 is a splice site mutation specific to isoform
unc-94a; sf20, has a stop codon, which is shared by
both unc-94a and unc-94b. Promoter-GFP analysis
revealed that unc-94a isexpressed mainly in body wall
muscle, whereas unc-94b is expressed mainly in pharyngeal
muscle. Anti-UNC-94 antibodies detect polypeptides of expected size
from wild type, wild type-sized proteins of reduced abundance from
unc-94(su177), and no detectable unc-94 products from
unc-94(sf20). These antibodies localize UNC-94 to two
closely spaced parallel lines, consistent with localization to the
pointed ends of thin filaments. In addition, UNC-94 is localized
near muscle cell to cell boundaries.
For unc-100, I characterized two alleles:
su115 and su149. By polarized light, myofibrils of
unc-100 animals are disorganized. EM shows missing M-lines,
broken dense bodies, and a lack of defined A and I-bands. Staining
of su115 muscle with antibodies to a variety of known
sarcomeric proteins revealed disruption of thick filaments, M-lines
and dense bodies. We used three-factor and SNP mapping to place
unc-100 within a 500 kb region. After performing transgenic
rescue, RNAi and/or sequencing many candidate genes within the
given region, we have yet to determine the molecular identity of
unc-100.","Chapter 1:

Amyloid: Merging the Properties of Membranes and Enzymes
By W. Seth Childers
Since the first observation of amyloid deposits more than 150 years
ago, amyloid fibers have
played a critical yet uncertain role in neurodegenerative disease.
At the core of this uncertainty are
the cross-Î² variations proposed to lead to distinct
amyloid polymorphs that underpin different
phenotypes. Yet it is unclear how peptide sequence directs
polymorphism and functional
differences. Here I have used the critical nucleating core of the
Alzheimer's Disease peptide, AÎ²(16-
22), as a model to address the molecular origins of amyloid
polymorphism and understand core
properties that lead to amyloid's diverse functions. Solid-state
NMR and diffraction studies revealed
that simple amino acid changes direct structural polymorphs by
modulating both Î²-strand and Î²-
sheet pleat registry. Interestingly, these short peptides form
hollow nanotubes in which peptides
interact via termini interactions to form a peptide bilayer wall.
Like membranes, these amyloid
assemblies have diverse conditionally dependent phases including
fibers, nanotubes, oligomers,
twisted and helical ribbons, and lamellar bundles of nanotubes. The
cross-Î² assemblies bind small
molecules (e.g. congo red) and precisely template them into
organized molecular arrays providing the
spectroscopic origins of congo red's apple-green birefringence. I
further demonstrated that these
lysine-rich amyloid assemblies serve as retro-aldolase catalysts.
Taken together, I argue that physical
properties of amyloids can best be seen as merging the long-range
order of membranes with the
catalytic features of enzymes and that simple amyloid structures
could provide an early prebiotic
catalyst leading to the emergence of complex chemical systems.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1: Amyloid - An Enigmatic Peptide

The Break through Experience: Literary Origins in Franz Kafka and
W. G. Sebald
This dissertation explores the intersection of autobiography and
literary production in the
works of two writers: the paradigmatically modern Franz Kafka, and
contemporary writer
of mixed-media prose, W. G. Sebald. The two cases are
complementary. While Kafka's
story ""The Judgment"" has been identified as his decisive literary
breakthrough, critics
maintain that Sebald, over the course of sundry publications, is
always working on the
same long novel. I ask why it is important for the critical
reception of modern literature
to situate an author's oeuvre with respect to its literary origins.
In keeping with the
modern uncertainty regarding what counts as literature, I examine
how both writers
undermine our ability to discern where the literary begins and
ends. Many of Kafka's
fragmentary fictions are recorded in his Diaries amidst
autobiographical and theoretical
passages which themselves have been canonized. Sebald's hybrid
works unsettle the
fictional in several ways: they are generically similar to his
literary
criticism, and incorporate unmarked quotations from European
literature of the past several centuries, photographs, and images
without captions. I argue
that Kafka's and Sebald's mingling of autobiographical,
literary-historical and
documentary elements with fiction disturbs our ability to 'place'
their writing
in literary history. Modern acts of literary production scramble
historiographical approaches
to literature by revealing the way in which the history of writing
fiction is
always a fictionalized history.
I locate the emergence of each project in its 19th-century French
literary sources.
Flaubert's work guides my reading of Kafka. Via Kafka's fantasy of
reading aloud
Flaubert's L'Ã‰ducation sentimentale, I explore
how the thematics of sound, breath and voice mediate the
transactions between Kafka's fictions and his
autobiographical writings. My Sebald chapters focus on a section of
his debut novel,
Schwindel. GefÃ¼hle., devoted to the life and
works of the French novelist and
autobiographer Stendhal. I uncover the aesthetic foundations of
Sebald's project in the
theory of occulted ""realism"" (both literary and pictorial), which
he articulates
anachronistically in response to Stendhal, and in response to the
history of realisms
in modern painting.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- INTRODUCTION 1 -- Overview 1 -- Enlargement 3

published,emory:7t409,"Gao, Jingjing",Assessing Observer Agreement for Categorical Observations,"Assessment of observer agreement is based on the
similarity between readings made on the same subject by different
observers. The assessment of agreement on categorical observations
is traditionally based on kappa or weighted kappa coefficients
(Cohen, 1960, 1968). However, kappa statistics have been criticized
because they attain implausible values when the marginal
distributions are skewed and/or unbalanced (Feinstein and
Cicchetti, 1990), and also because they depend on the prevalence of
the underlying condition (Kraemer, 1979; Thompson and Walter,
1988).
We propose new scaled indices called the coefficients of
individual agreement (CIAs) for the assessment of individual
observer agreement by comparing the observed disagreement between
two observers to the disagreement between replicated observations
made by the same observer on the same subject. This is based on the
notion that the agreement between the two observers is usually not
expected to be better than the agreement between replicated
observations of the same observer, and hence, a satisfactory
agreement is established if these quantities are similar. We
investigate two scenarios: (1) when the data can be considered as
unmatched replicated measurements; (2) when the
data consist of matched repeated observations measured by the same
observer under different conditions.
In addition, we consider two situations: (1) a symmetric
assessment of agreement between two observers, and (2) an
assessment of the agreement of a new observer with a reference. We
propose simple methods for the estimation of the new agreement
coefficients as well as their standard errors. The reliability of
the estimation methods are examined via simulation studies. Two
biomedical examples are used to illustrate the new concepts and
methods.","Contents -- 1

Jim Brown: Cinematic Integration and Re-Segregation,
1967-1972
By Joshua Gleich
Jim Brown announced his early retirement from the NFL in 1966,
leaving the league as
arguably its most dominant player in history, to pursue a Hollywood
acting career. After
the extraordinary success of The Dirty Dozen (1967), he
became a leading man by 1968,
reaching the peak of his acting career in 100 Rifles (1969).
In the process, he shattered
many of Hollywood's and America's most deep seated racial taboos;
however after
crossing the onscreen miscegenation barrier for African-American
men in 100 Rifles, his
career began a precipitous decline. By the early 1970's, he had
been re-segregated to
""Blaxploitation"" features, losing almost the entire white audience
that had supported his
mainstream Hollywood career. This thesis examines the major
industrial, cinematic, and
cultural changes that rapidly ballasted and later destroyed his
popular cinema stardom.","Table of Contents -- Introduction ….. 1 -- Chapter 1…..

published,emory:1592k,"Flick, Andrew C","  Utilization of a Michael Addition-Dipolar Cycloaddition Cascade Involving 2,3- bis(Phenylsulfonyl)butadiene for Alkaloid Synthesis   ","The azaspirocyclic nucleus is a structural motif found in a wide variety of medicinally relevant natural products. A unique and operationally-simple approach to the construction of this structural subunit was developed and makes use of readily available oxime substrates and a disubstituted diene. The reaction platform represents facile entry into complex azacyclic structures, permitting rapid generation of a variety of 2,2-disubstituted piperidine derivatives.
Approaches to several natural product alkaloid targets are presented utilizing the tandem Michael Addition-Dipolar Cycloaddition Cascade. The key element of each synthesis consisted of a conjugate addition of an oxime to one of the termini of 2,3-bis(phenylsulfonyl)butadiene, followed by a proton transfer to give a nitrone intermediate. This nitrone immediately cyclizes across the tethered p-bond providing unique azaoxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes with diastereospecificity. The N-O bond in these systems was readily cleaved under reductive conditions to furnish functionalizable 4-piperidone subunits. Depending on the nature of the starting oxime, 4-piperidone core structures were generated which allowed for the total syntheses of ()-cylindricine C, ()-7,8-epi-perhydrohistrionicotoxin, and ()-yohimbenone. Formal syntheses of ()-desamyl-perhydrohistrionicotoxin and ()-emetine were reached through this reaction manifold, as well as an approach to halichlorine. The method's tractability is underscored by its versatility, operational ease, and its ability to employ readily available oxime inputs. A previously unreported ring-oxidation mechanism involving N-alkyl-4-piperidones is also described, as well as a novel [4+2]-cycloaddition involving an oxofuran derivative.",

Middle Aged Men?
By Amit Shah

OBJECTIVE: Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of
autonomic function, has been
associated with cognitive function, but studies are conflicting.
Previous studies have also
not controlled for familial and genetic influences.

METHODS: We performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour
ambulatory ECG's in 416
middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Memory
and learning were
measured by verbal and visual selective reminding tests (SRT).
Mixed-effect regression
models were used to calculate associations between and within twin
pairs, while
adjusting for covariates.

RESULTS: The mean age ± SD was 55 ± 2.9 years. A
statistically significant positive
association was found between measures of HRV and verbal, but not
visual, SRT
scores. The most statistically significant unadjusted association
was found between very
low frequency (VLF) HRV and verbal total recall SRT, such that each
natural logarithm
of increase in VLF was associated with an increased verbal SRT
score of 4.85 points
(p=0.002). The association persisted despite adjustment for
demographic and
cardiovascular risk factors, and after accounting for familial, and
genetic factors by
comparing twins within pairs. A significant interaction was found
between post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and HRV, such that total power and ultra low
frequency were
associated with SRT in twins (n=362) without PTSD, but not in those
with PTSD. 
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, lower frequency spectra of HRV
are associated with
verbal, but not visual, learning and memory, particularly in
subjects without PTSD. This
association may highlight mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction and
have implications on
prevention and therapy of cognitive decline.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction

CRHR1 and CRHR2 pre-treatment gene expression may predict malignant
melanoma
patients' neuropsychiatric responses to IL-2 therapy
By Caitlin N. Barbarita
Although, Interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy has been shown to
be successful in initiating tumor regression in up to 20% of
malignant melanoma patients, it induces an array of toxicities that
hinder effective treatment. Corticotropin Releasing Hormone
receptors 1 and 2 (CRHR1 and CRHR2, respectively) expression on the
pituitary are known to affect the HPA axis, the functioning of
which is believed to be altered in these patients. The following
study examines the relationship between CRHR1 and CRHR2
pre-treatment expression in patient blood samples and patients'
neuropsychiatric responses to IL-2 therapy.
After providing informed consent, 20 patients with Stage IV
melanoma eligible for IL-2 immunotherapy were recruited. Prior to,
during, and after IL-2 administration we measured genetic
expression of CRHR1 and CRHR2, plasma concentrations of ACTH and
IL-6, neurobehavioral symptoms, and tolerance of IL-2 treatment. A
neurobehavioral analysis was performed utilizing two symptom
complexes, mood and neurovegetative. Non-parametric statistics were
used to examine changes in biological and behavioral variables.
Spearman's correlation and simple linear regression determined
relationships between CRHR1 and CRHR2 gene expression, IL-2 dose
tolerance, and neurobehavioral symptoms.
Linear regression models were statistically insignificant;
however we did see a statistically significant positive partial
correlation between IL-2 doses tolerated and CRHR1 gene expression
within the model. This small study illustrates the need for further
understanding of the mechanisms of symptom development and
treatment response during IL-2 immunotherapy.","Table of Contents --

Novel Objects in 3-Year-Olds","Abstract
The Roles of Comparison and Function in the Categorization of Novel
Objects in 3-Year-Olds
In early development, children learn to organize their environment
into categories, often
using an object's shape as a basis for category membership (e.g.,
grouping an apple with other
round objects). However, when children have the opportunity to
compare similarly shaped
objects from the same category (e.g., an apple and a pear), they
are more likely to group objects
based on function even when the function match is perceptually
dissimilar (e.g., a banana). Even
in the absence of comparison, children can extend category
membership by function when
functional information is highlighted. The current studies explore
the unique and combined roles
of comparison and function in the assimilation of novel
instances (e.g., a kiwano) into familiar
categories (e.g., fruit). In Experiment 1, 3-year-olds viewed one
or two photographs of familiar
exemplars drawn from the same familiar category and selected
another category member
between two objects: a perceptually similar, outside-of-category,
familiar object (e.g., a balloon)
and a perceptually dissimilar, within-category, novel object (e.g.,
a kiwano). Children, regardless
of whether they viewed one or two objects, preferred the familiar
perceptual match to the novel
category match. In Experiment 2, when the perceptual and category
matches were both novel,
children displayed evidence of benefiting from comparison.
Functional information, however,
did not increase category responses, suggesting that highlighting
function may fail to increase
awareness of functionally relevant, perceptual properties.
Together, these findings underscore the
difficulty in assimilating novel objects into familiar categories
but demonstrate that comparison
may assist in this process.","-- I.

The regulation of Base Excision Repair by Sumoylation in
Saccharomyces cerevisiaeBy Harry R. Powers
Oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species is one of the
main sources of DNA damage in
the cell. Oxidative DNA damage can be cytotoxic or mutagenic and is
also know to contribute to
the development of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging
in humans. In order to
combat these deleterious effects, cells have evolved DNA repair
pathways. The main repair
pathway for oxidative DNA damage is the base excision repair (BER)
pathway. In this project,
we are investigating the Saccharomyces cerevisiae BER protein, Ntg1
which is a bifunctional N-
glycosylase and AP lyase. Ntg1 is know to be modified by the small
ubiquitin-like modifier
(SUMO) in response to oxidative stress. We hypothesize that
sumoylation is regulating the
function of Ntg1 to repair nuclear DNA in response to oxidative
stress. In order to determine the
function of the sumoylation of Ntg1, it was first necessary to
identify the sites of sumoylation of
Ntg1. Putative sumoylation sites were identified using SUMO site
prediction software. Site-
directed mutagenesis was used to generate Ntg1 with lysine to
arginine substitutions at the
putative sumoylation sites. Immunbloting was then employed to
determine the sumoylation
status of the Ntg1 mutants. Our results indicated that Ntg1 is
sumoylated at least five residues.
The C-terminus is the main site of SUMO modification of Ntg1 with
K396 being the principle
sumoylation site followed by K376 and K388. Additional, tertiary
sites of sumoylation are
located at K20 and K38, both on the N-terminus. From this research,
a non-sumoylatable Ntg1
has been created that can be used in functional studies to
determine the manner in which
sumoylation regulates the function of Ntg1.","Table of Contents --

determine population-level brain networks revealed by functional

Works of Sylvia Plath, Anne Carson, and Mei-mei Berssenbrugge","Although Sylvia Plath stands as an
iconic figure for the emergence of the feminine lyric voice in
20th century American poetry, the popular interpretation
of this voice as a ""confessional"" one has misrepresented the
significance of her work by framing it largely within the confines
of biographical studies. This focus has camouflaged an important
aspect of Plath's poetry, namely, how it stages the crisis
attendant to the figuration of the feminine lyric voice. Plath's
work operates within what I've identified as a culturally dominant
""script for seeing,"" a detached gaze that assumes a masculine
""I/eye"" and a feminine object. As a result, the feminine
""subject,"" that appears in Plath's work is one which can't claim a
lyric voice - it is muted and artificial, a victim of the
objectification of the script her poems stage. Plath's work does
not merely re-enact this script; it also comments upon it, exposing
its violence and cruelty through hyperbolic
theatricality. Plath's
dramatic staging of this crisis which haunts the birth of feminine
lyric subjectivity shapes and invites new and vital forms of poetic
dialogue, examples of which can be found in the works of two
contemporary women poets, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge and Anne Carson.
Albeit in different ways, both poets open up new possibilities for
conceptualizing feminine subjectivity by revising the kind of
""script for sight"" that dominates Plath's lyric voice. Anne
Carson's subject resists the de-humanization of Plath's theatrical
self-presentation by moving ""offstage"" into the margins where
meaning cannot be seen but must be read. Although Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge's work, like Carson's,
seeks to disempower visual objectification, it does this not by
undermining the link between language and perception, but rather by
expanding and complicating that connection. Her work carves
a space for feminine subjectivity without separating itself from
the realm of representation, locating latent possibility and
""interiority"" within outward forms. In
their poetic engagement with notions of vision and subjectivity,
both Anne Carson and Mei-mei Berssenbrugge elude the traps of
feminine representation embodied in Plath's work and open up new
possibilities for figuring the feminine lyric
voice.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1 -

This study evaluated mechanisms through which intervention effects
were achieved in a
cognitive dissonance-based program (CD) that significantly reduced
eating disorder risk
factors among sorority women. CD is hypothesized to reduce body
dissatisfaction, and
thus risk for disordered eating. More importantly CD is
hypothesized to reduce body
dissatisfaction primarily through reducing the degree of thin-ideal
internalization
(Becker, Smith &amp; Ciao, 2005). Thus, the current study evaluated
the degree to which
thin-ideal internalization and body dissatisfaction each serve as
specific mechanisms of
change within CD. CD produced significant reductions in the outcome
measures (dietary
restraint and eating disorder pathology) and in reductions in both
of the mediators (thin-
ideal internalization and body dissatisfaction). Our results
provide some support for
partial and complete mediation in outcome measures during
intervention and in change
sustained from pre-intervention to one-month follow-up. Our data
suggest, however, that
ultimately reduced body dissatisfaction is the primary mediator of
sustained reductions in
eating disordered behaviors.","Table of Contents --

Trends to Facilitate Public Health Preparedness","Extreme heat events (EHEs) are expected to intensify in North
America in the 21st
century, posing challenges outside current public health capacity.
Adaptation will likely
be required to minimize health impacts. Most adaptation to date has
been in response to
extreme weather events, e.g., the response to the European heat
wave of 2003. The US
has not experienced a similarly dramatic EHE and likely has a
significant preparedness
deficit. Scenario-driven table-top exercises are one way to
facilitate preparedness, but
these require credible projections of climatic shifts. Downscaled
projections are
computationally expensive, unavailable for most localities, and
most public health
agencies cannot make their own. Given the advent of warming trends
in many locales,
our objective is to determine whether it is appropriate to use
historical weather data to
project future temperature trends. Such an approach is relatively
straightforward,
intuitive, inexpensive, scalable, and generalizable compared with
downscaled projections.
To test this proposition, we used a dataset of historical weather
for selected major US
cities to identify appropriate indicators for projection, test
multiple methods for
extrapolating historical trends, project findings forward by
climate region and city, and
compare findings with available downscaled projections. Average
daily temperature,
average daily maximum temperature, and maximum of the daily maximum
temperature
in June-July-August (JJA) from 1950-2010 were selected as
indicators. Stepwise
autoregressive methods were used to generate polynomial projections
of the indicators.
The projections most consistent with historical data occurred with
the indicators of
central tendency and showed mostly positive trends (e.g., average
daily temperatures in
JJA in the Southeast are projected to increase by 5.6°F by
2035, and 10.0°F by 2055).
Negative trends for extremes (maximum of the daily maximum
temperature in JJA)
resulted for three regions. The trends were determined to be a
function of the
extrapolation method and greater variability in historical data for
these regions. Available
downscaled regional projections were in concordance with our
findings that much of the
US will experience warming in the future. We conclude that this
approach has promise
but may systematically underestimate the magnitude of likely future
temperature changes
in regions with variable historical temperature trends.","Table of Contents --

Simmel, reveals self-knowledge to be the dialectic of praxis
(activity) and theoria (contemplation) grounded in human
desire. Only through communal recognition of material objects
labored over and transformed by individuals can self-knowledge be
realized. This means self-knowledge emanates from vibrant culture.
Applying this conception of self-knowledge to the ""late modern""
period, however, provesdifficult. Siegfried Kracauer and theorists
of the Frankfurt School persuasively argue that industrial and
technological advancements in the twentieth century make
self-expression and formation of particular communities
implausible. In other words, the self is perpetually alienated from
culture. I lastly turn to contemporary movements in visual art to
verify if gnothi seauton is utterly loss in late modernity.
The sculptures of Jeff Koons affirm the thesis of the Frankfurt
School and art critic Clement Greenberg. Fortunately, the dynamic
artworks of Thornton Dial suggest self-knowledge as grounded in
culture is still viable in late modernity.","Introduction 2 -- 1. Late Modern Conceptions of Self 6 -- 2. The

Argentina, 1966-1983","A series of military dictatorships and authoritarian civilian
governments from 1966 to 1983 made a claim to sovereign power based
on the exclusion of young people. As police and military forces
occupied universities and limited political participation, young
people attempted to fortify their generational identity and
recuperate autonomy. The identities of rebel, martyr, and hero
intertwined in varying expressions, and in each instance, young
people used these categories to produce collective memory as a way
of sustaining their generational identity.
Commemorative acts often identified individuals who had been
injured, killed or threatened in confrontations with the military
or police, and reenacted previous demonstrations. The number of
idealized rebels, martyrs, and heroes swelled during university
occupations in Buenos Aires and provincial capitals in 1966 and in
protests like the 1969 Cordobazo in CÃ³rdoba. Conflicts
between right wing governments and left wing Peronist groups
including the Montoneros and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
turned to retributive violence following the Trelew and Ezeiza
Massacres in 1972 and 1973. Responding to growing conflicts,
including the Marxist-Leninist group EjÃ©rcito
Revolucionario del Pueblo's attack on the Monte Chingolo military
installment in 1975, military leaders mobilized young people's real
or alleged involvement in violence to legitimize repressive
tactics. The military dictatorship that governed Argentina between
1976 and 1983 intensified political repression through the practice
of forced disappearance and foreclosed the kinds of commemorative
practices that young people used to claim political inclusion.
Drawing on extensive archival research, interviews with
historical participants, and audiovisual recordings, this
dissertation argues that the Argentine military's power over life
and death compelled young people to create modes of collective
memory that venerated their peers' lives. Analyzing intersections
between political life and mourning, and examining practices of
reenactment and commemoration that blurred the lines between live
and grieved bodies, the dissertation shows how and why young people
put their bodies at risk to challenge authoritarian practices. The
dissertation joins scholarly conversations that interrogate how a
spectrum of disciplinary technologies and commemorative practices
shape the construction of life, the state of exception, and the
potentialities of community.","Introduction Generational Identity and Collective Memory: Bare Life

care clinics","Background: Missed medical
appointments (""no shows"") affect both staff and other patients who
are unable to make timely appointments. No shows can be prevented
through interventions that target those most at risk to make
appointments. Young age, low socioeconomic status, a history of
missed appointments, psychosocial problems, and longer wait times
are some predictors that have been previously found to be
associated with higher no show rates. Objective: This study
aimed to determine the potential risk factors for no shows in
primary care clinics of the Veterans Affairs Nebraska-Western Iowa
Health Care System (VA NWI HCS). Design: Age, sex, race,
presence of a mental health diagnosis, previous no show rate in
past two years, wait time, distance to clinic, and neighborhood
deprivation index were obtained for 69,908 primary care visits at
the Omaha, Nebraska VA NWI HCS between January 1, 2012 and December
31, 2013. Inclusion criteria were visits for patients whose zip
code was within the VA NWI HCS Service Area and non-cancelled
appointments at the Omaha primary care clinics. Results: In
log-binomial models accounting for clustering by zip code, the
strongest predictors of no shows were age between 20 and 39
(OR=3.86, 95% CI=3.46, 4.29) or between 40 and 59 (OR=2.22, 95% CI=
2.04, 2.42), black (OR=2.14, 95% CI=1.99, 2.31) or other non-white
race (OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.17, 1.56), male sex (OR=1.29, 95% CI=1.15,
1.44), and presence of mental health diagnosis (OR=1.16, 95%
CI=1.15, 1.44). Conclusion: These results show that
individuals who are younger, non-white, male or have been diagnosed
with mental health issues are more likely to no show. Interventions
to improve compliance could be targeted at these individuals in
order to decrease the burden of no shows on healthcare systems,
such as the Veterans Health Administration.","Chapter 1. Background/Literature

published,emory:br8w8,"Vakili, Jessica","Identification of an Effective Diabetes Screening Strategy:
Analysis of the Screening for Impaired Glucose Tolerance Study","Background: Establishing an effective and systematic formal
screening test is ideal for managing the
public health burden resulting from diabetes. The oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) is the standard to
identify diabetes with maximum sensitivity and specificity.
However, this test is quite time intensive and
inconvenient for patients. We sought to determine if pairing
simpler tests together might be a reasonable
substitute for OGTT.

Methods: The final sample of the Screening for Impaired
Glucose Tolerance study involved 1,573
subjects without known diabetes. Tests collected on these subjects
included random plasma glucose
(RPG), hemoglobin A1c, glucose challenge test (GCT), fasting plasma
glucose (FPG), and an OGTT.
Four different disease statuses were defined to signify a positive
diagnosis for diabetes. For each
definition of diabetes, receiver operating characteristic curve
were produced for individual tests as well as
for combinations of two tests.

Results: Despite disease status, OGTT and FPG consistently
had the two highest areas under the curve
analyzing all subjects. Additionally, the majority of paired tests
were significantly higher than their
matching single tests proving combinations of simple tests improve
screening accuracy. FPG + GCT was
the combined test identified with the highest area under the curve
for standard diabetes and high-risk
prediabetes. Instead of using an OGTT, GCT could be performed
conveniently during an outpatient visit,
followed by an FPG in patients previously screened with GCT.

Discussion: Our data and results do suggest that strong
consideration should be given to screening. These
findings propose that opportunistic screening in a clinical setting
of individuals at high-risk would be
justified and thus will help delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
Further research of this screening methods'
cost effectiveness would be necessary as well as future research
into additional diabetes screening
methods.","-- Table of Contents --

Cognitive Control in Response to Sexual Interference Stimuli in
Fathers and Non-fathers","Abstract

Despite the fact that there is great variation in human paternal
care, its benefits to
children are immense and well documented. Life History Theory
suggests that men
pursue a reproductive strategy on a spectrum from mating effort to
parenting effort. The
purpose of this study is to investigate behavioral, hormonal and
neurobiological
differences between fathers and non-fathers through four aims. We
use a choice reaction
time task with sexual interference in fMRI to investigate brain and
behavioral differences
in reaction to sexual stimuli. Additionally, we investigate
differences in testosterone
levels and differences in brain structure. We found that fathers
are less distracted by
sexual interference stimuli than non-fathers, as measured by
reaction time. Those with the
slowest reaction times engaged the cognitive and emotional control
areas of their
prefrontal cortex less than those with faster reaction times.
Fathers have lower baseline
levels of testosterone than non-fathers, and those with higher
baseline levels of
testosterone engage their prefrontal cortex less during the
reaction time task. Our results
also suggest that fathers have greater gray matter density than
non-fathers in the medial
oribital frontal cortex and rostral ACC. These results suggest that
differences between
fathers and non-fathers manifest themselves in differences in
behavior, brain structure
and function, and hormones.","  -- Table of Contents -- I. --

I/II Clinical Trials","To save time and resources in new drug development, Phase I/II
clinical trials with toxicity response and drug efficacy as dual
primary endpoints have become increasingly popular. Escalation with
over dose control (EWOC) is a leading Bayesian adaptive Phase I
clinical trial design that can accurately estimate maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) and control the probability of overdosing
patients during dose allocation. To adapt EWOC to Phase I/II
clinical trials, we have used it as a framework to incorporate the
Gumbel Copula model and additional under-dosing control to
guarantee minimum drug efficacy for patients. A utility
function is proposed to estimate the composite effect of toxicity
and efficacy. The final recommended dose is determined by
maximizing this utility. Late onset and missing efficacy data are
common in Phase I/II clinical trials, especially during early
stages when patients are treated at low doses. Therefore, we
further employed the Bayesian data augmentation (DA)
algorithm to impute values for late onset or delayed efficacy data.
The resulting new Phase I/II design, which can monitor
toxicity and efficacy simultaneously, is named Dose
Escalation with Over-Dose and Under-Dose Control using Data
Augmentation (EWOUC-DA). The underlying theory of EWOUC-DA is
elaborated and extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate its
performance and operating characteristics. EWOUC-DA has been
demonstrated to provide better over-dose control, optimize utility,
and reduce the risk of failure in Phase III clinical trials
compared to EWOC. Hence, EWOUC-DA can address the new requisites of
Phase I/II clinical trials, reduce the cost of clinical trials, and
largely shorten the duration of new drug development.","1.

colorectal adenomas: Analysis of a case-control study","Background: Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce colorectal
carcinogenesis, but results from epidemiologic studies are
inconsistent. We investigated associations of omega-3 fatty acids
with risk of colorectal adenomas in a case-control study, and
whether they were modified by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) use.
Methods: The MAP I study was a community-,
colonoscopy-based case-control study of colorectal adenomas.
Participants aged 30 - 74 years with no history of colorectal
neoplasms who had outpatient colonoscopy were recruited from
gastroenterology practices from 1995 to 1997. The final sample
included 177 incident sporadic adenoma cases and 228 controls.
Prior to undergoing colonoscopy, participants completed
questionnaires eliciting demographics, medical history, and dietary
intake. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated
using logistic regression models.
Results: Cases were older, more often men, and did not
regularly take NSAIDs. Higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids were
associated with more than a doubling of risk of adenomas. In
contrast, a higher ratio of omega-3 fatty acids to total fat was
associated with a significant nearly halving of adenoma risk.
Higher levels of fish were also significantly associated with
decreased risk of adenoms (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.20, 0.68;
ptrend = 0.01). The direct associations of
omega-3 fatty acids with adenoma was stronger in those with a
family history of colorectal cancer (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.06, 12.24),
and those with low total fat intakes (OR 4.45; 95% CI 1.83, 10.82).
The inverse associations of fish with adenoma were stronger in
those with a family history of colorectal cancer (OR 0.20, 95% CI
0.03, 0.68).
Conclusions: In summary, we found statistically
significant evidence for reduced risk of colorectal adenoma with
higher intakes of fish. However, our findings for omega-3 fatty
acid intakes were inconsistent, likely because intakes were
homogeneous within the low end of the range of omega-3 fatty
intake. Further study of fish and omega-3 fatty acid associations
with incident, sporadic colorectal adenoma is indicated, especially
in light of widespread use of supplemental omega-3 fatty acids by
the general public.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

extending the Theory of Gender and Power
","The three structures of the Theory of Gender and Power (TGP):
the sexual division of labor; the structure of affective
attachments and social norms (SAASN); and the sexual division of
power, are hypothesized to have profound influences on risk for
HIV/STDs among African American females. However, relationships
between the structures have not been articulated and the processes
by which influences with the SAASN affect sexual decision making
(SDM) have not explored among African American young women. The
goals of this research were to: (1) examine the existing literature
to understand how the structures have been linked previously, (2)
empirically test the direct and indirect effects of the structures
on condom use, and (3) qualitatively explore in depth constructs
within the SAASN as influences on SDM. The systematic review
indicated variability in the measurement of TGP constructs and a
paucity of analyses of mediation. The empirical test of the
structures (N=701) provided evidence of direct and indirect
associations between condom use and associated social and
behavioral risk factors. The qualitative study (N=20) indicated
that expectations of relationships varied based on the nature of
parental relationships and SDM was related to these expectations.
The systematic review and the empirical test of a model of condom
use suggest that there are important relationships between TGP
structures for interventionists to understand. Exploring processes
within SAASN provided insight into how caregivers influence SDM.
These findings provide new directions for measuring and modeling
TGP constructs.","CHAPTER 1. Literature Review 1 --

and Heart Failure Outcomes","Background:
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinases(TIMPs) are involved in cardiac remodeling
through regulation of extracellular matrix. Reports on their
association with heart failure (HF) outcomes have been
conflicting.
Methods:
We prospectively examined the association of baseline serum
levels of MMP 1, 2, and 9, and TIMP 1,2, 3, and 4, with; a)
combined outcomes (death or cardiac transplantation or left
ventricular assist device implantation), b) HF hospitalization, c)
six minute walk distance, and d) KCCQ Scores; in147 ambulatory HF
patients. Levels of MMPs and TIMPs were measured by Fluorokine
MAPHuman MMP and TIMP Kits.
Results:
Mean age of patients was 57.1± 11.9 years, 67% were male;
and 58% were white. Mean ejection fraction (EF) was 24.6 ±
10.9 %. During follow-up of mean 23.1 ± 6.7 months, 49
patients (33%) experienced combined outcome. 22 of these 49
patients had either died, had transplants or LVADS and remaining 27
had HF related hospitalizations . Among the biomarkers of collagen
turnover, there were several inter-correlations but MMP-2 and
TIMP-2 had the strongest correlation to each other( r= 0.77,
p=&lt;.0001). As for cardiac structural and functional parameters,
TIMP-2 was significantly and negatively correlated to EF (r =
-0.26, p=0.002, n=146) and Six Minute Walk Test(r= -0.19, P=0.03,
n=137). TIMP-2 was also positively and significantly correlated to
cardiac neurohormone BNP (r=0.20, p=0.03, n=117). In Univariate Cox
regression analysis TIMP-2 was the strongest predictor of the
outcome among the biomarkers of collagen turnover (HR 1.019,
95%CI(1.007 -1.032) for each 1 pg/ml increase. When dichotomized at
133.82 pg/ml based on linearity, the event rate in the group &gt;
133.82 pg/ml was 59.5% n=37 vs &lt; 133.82 pg/ml was 24.5 % n=110.
In Cox regression model controlling for age, gender, EF, past
medical history, creatinine, and current therapy, TIMP-2 level &gt;
133.82 was independent predictor of adverse outcomes (OR 6,95%CI
2.22-16.12). The final parsimonious multivariate cox regression
Model containing TIMP-2, age, creatinine and sleep apnea, TIMP-2
level &gt; 133.82 had a HR of 4.46(2.1-9.4).
Conclusion:
Elevated serum levels of TIMP-2 were independently associated
with adverse outcomes in HF.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction and

language to English, and the economic importance of the native
language all have explanatory power over the differences in English
proficiency between EU countries. For the globalization variables,
although strong correlation with English proficiency exists, not
much evidence to suggest a causal relationship is found. However,
there is preliminary evidence to suggest that one globalization
variable, the strength of the country's tourism industry, might
have explanatory power over variation in English proficiency within
countries.
In the future, this project could be improved upon when
there are more Eurobarometer survey data, thus increasing the
sample size. The methodology could also be improved upon with the
use of instrumental variables to better account for endogeneity
bias.","Table of Contents -- I) Introduction 1 -- II) Literature Review 4

Critical Philosophy:
Immanuel Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason
By
Colin McQuillan
Critical Philosophy: Immanuel Kant and the Critique of Pure
Reason examines the concept of ""critique,"" as it is employed by
Immanuel Kant in the Critique
of Pure Reason (1781/1787). While many readers assume that Kant
intended the Critique of Pure Reason to
establish the limits of reason, my dissertation shows that the work
attempts to determine the possibility
of a science of metaphysics through a critique of the faculty of
human reason. The critical approach to
metaphysics that Kant develops in the Critique of Pure Reason is
novel, because critique had been a
primarily philological concept in the eighteenth century, when it
was associated with the authentication
of ancient texts and the determination of their sources. Kant
appropriated the term in the early 1770's,
applying it to a problem with which he had been concerned since the
time of his earliest, ""pre-critical""
works. This is the problem of the proper method of metaphysics. The
discussions of a critique of pure
reason that are to be found in Kant's notes, lectures, and
correspondence, as well as the Critique of Pure
Reason itself, afford us a unique insight into the development of
Kant's ""critical"" philosophy, when we
realize that they are the direct result of Kant's application of
the concept of critique to problem of the
proper method of metaphysics. By examining these texts, my
dissertation helps scholars to understand
the reasons why Kant thought the possibility of a science of
metaphysics depended upon the
determination and authentication of the sources of metaphysics in
the faculties of human reason. It
provides a historical and contextual account of the development of
Kant's critical philosophy which is
unique in the scholarly literature.

published,emory:phm30,"Ryan, Steven John","Developmental Regulation of Membrane Potential Oscillations in
the Basolateral Amygdala: Modulation by Beta-Adrenergic Receptor
Activation","The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is a brain region
of fundamental importance in enabling emotional memory. A wealth of
evidence also demonstrates the causative role that dysfunction of
the BLA can play in many psychiatric disorders, which often emerge
during juvenile and adolescent brain development. In order to
effectively treat these disorders, interventions must be developed
that are appropriate to the age of diagnosis. The existing
literature demonstrates a large number of BLA-dependent behaviors
mature during juvenile development, which suggests there must be
massive concomitant changes to how the BLA processes information.
Despite the apparent importance and dynamic nature of BLA
development, however, almost nothing is known about the normative
development of the juvenile BLA. In this dissertation, we begin to
address this knowledge gap by performing an extensive
characterization of the physiology and morphology of developing BLA
principal neurons with the ultimate goal of identifying putative
critical periods which may exhibit particular sensitivity to
disruption or opportunity for intervention.
In adult rats, synchronized neural activity in the BLA and
related regions is critical for emotional memory formation. Little
was known, however, about the cellular mechanisms contributing to
synchronization in the BLA, or if a similar process was utilized
across development to regulate affective behavior. Toward this end,
we first explore low-frequency membrane potential oscillations and
synchronous synaptic activity in adult rats. We were able to evoke
low-frequency MPOs in BLA principal neurons and provide evidence
suggesting that these oscillations serve to synchronize the
activity of large ensembles of neurons. We also show that these
MPOs are subject to modulation by intracellular signaling cascade
which is itself regulated by the activity of neuromodulators. These
results motivated us to explore the development of this critical
facet of BLA physiology. However, in order to effectively do so, we
needed to characterize more fundamental aspects of the development
of BLA principal neurons. Thus, we next characterized the intrinsic
physiology and dendritic morphology of these neurons. These studies
showed dramatic maturation of the BLA across the first postnatal
month: neuronal input resistance drops by nearly 10-fold, intrinsic
voltage-gated currents mature substantially, and aggregate
dendritic length increases by nearly 4-fold. Many other dramatic
changes unfold over this same period, which we discuss in detail
below. Finally, catecholaminergic innervation of the BLA shows
major changes over this same time period, and we further
demonstrated a developmental progression in the ability of
norepinephrine to enhance tuned, frequency-specific MPOs and to
facilitate organized firing activity by synchronous synaptic
activity. These studies will provide an important context for
future work looking at the development of psychiatric disorders in
the juvenile brain.","Table of Contents -- Chapter 1 - General Introduction

find a substantial difference in Ts between samples cast on
clear quartz slides and on ITO-coated

this study has laid the groundwork for continuing florescence

Childhood Obesity and Parental Perceptions of
Healthcare Quality
Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the
association between parental
perceptions of healthcare quality and overweight/obese status of
children using a nationally
representative survey.
Research methods and Procedures: This study analyzed the National
Survey of Children's
Health, 2007 and included 41,915 children who had BMI percentiles
reported. The outcome
variable was dichotomized into overweight/obese and healthy weight
children. The exposure
variables were four questions pertaining to healthcare quality
derived from the NSCH survey:
These inquired whether parents felt that healthcare providers spent
enough time with their
children, provided specific information needed, listened carefully
to parents or made parents
feel like a partner in child's healthcare. Possible confounders of
this relationship were age, sex,
race, poverty level, whether child has a usual source of
healthcare, health insurance status and
mother's education level. Multivariate logistic regression analysis
was used to investigate the
relationship between weight categories and each these healthcare
quality indices.
Results: Of the 41,915 children analyzed, 31% were overweight or
obese. Crude estimates
revealed that parents of overweight or obese children reported
lower levels of satisfaction than
parents of healthy weight children with regards to time spent
(p&lt;0.01), providing specific
information needed (p=0.016), listening carefully to parent
(p&lt;0.01) and feeling like a partner in
child's healthcare (p=0.024). However these results are attenuated
and no longer significant
when adjusted for other variables.
Discussion: This study finds no significant association between
parental perceptions of quality
of healthcare delivered to children based on their weight status.
This may be represent an
opportunity to reduce childhood obesity rates by harnessing
provider parent relationships.","Table of contents --

This paper examines similarity measures (also known as
dissimilarity or statistical distance
measures) for flow cytometry data. Similarity measures quantify the
similarity between two
objects and could be used for clustering or neighborhood-based
predictive modeling. I find that
earth mover's distance is the most appropriate tool for creating
similarity measures for flow
cytometry data. I compare this approach to earlier approaches that
relied on Kullback-Leibler
divergence, Pearson correlation or Lp distance. This paper also
examines diversity measures for
flow cytometry data. It identifies two types of diversity measures,
""nominal diversity measures""
and ""interval diversity measure"", and it explains the connection
between diversity measures
and similarity measures.

The similarity and diversity measures in this paper were designed
for flow cytometry data, but
they can be used for any dataset that consists of multisets of
equal-dimensional points. This
paper includes R code for implementing many of the methods
discussed. The datasets used in
this paper have been made publicly available.","Table of Contents -- I.

Denial Notices","This thesis examines the construction and content of Social
Security Disability Insurance
(SSDI) denial notices in order to gain a better understanding of
the culture of the Social Security
Administration (SSA) and the government's conception of disability.
I approach this study from
a rhetorical standpoint and combine a close textual analysis with a
review of the creation of the
SSDI program. By breaking down the notices into a series of speech
acts through genre analysis,
I have studied why each portion was incorporated into the text.
Understanding why certain
phrases and sentences were included or omitted from the notices
reveals that the work aspect of
the SSDI definition of disability is most important to the
government. I conclude that the flaws
within the language of the correspondence result from problems in
the creation and
implementation of the disability insurance program. Claimants have
often complained about the
correspondence from the SSA due to the confusing information
conveyed, and this study reveals
that this is because the government uses a definition of disability
that has not been updated since
the 1950's. My analysis shows that while the government
successfully defends its definition of
disability in the notices, the letters justify a meaning that no
longer corresponds with today's
understanding of the term. The disconnect between the current and
past ideas of disability are a
source of the problems in the language of the notices. While these
notices were supposed to be
useful tools for prospective beneficiaries, over time this
intention has been waylaid by other
problems in the SSDI system, like controlling approval rates or
using an outdated conception of
disability.","Table of Contents -- Introduction

published,emory:bs8xg,"Hashimoto, Barry Masanori","The Power and Politicized Expansion of the International
Criminal Court","Abstract
This dissertation contributes to an understanding of why national
leaders voluntarily accept the
jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC), granting it
the authority to prosecute them.
It theorizes that leaders trade off the risk of unwanted
prosecutions against the deterrent threat
that prosecutions pose to political rivals and patrons of domestic
enemies, who may conspire to
violently oust leaders. The risk of unwanted prosecutions and the
ICC's deterrent threat both arise
because the court's prosecutions credibly communicate guilt for
atrocities and may trigger leader-specific
sanctions by wealthy donor states that prefer to keep politicians
who commit atrocities out
of office. Three qualities explain the ICC's credibility: a
legitimacy quality, an investment quality,
and a reputational quality. Empirical analysis of panel data on
leaders and all modern international
criminal courts supports the theory. National leaders accept the
ICC's jurisdiction when it can
deter their rivals from anti-regime violence--when the state
depends heavily on development
capital disbursed by wealthy democracies--and when the leaders can
limit their own exposure
to prosecution. The protection leaders obtain under the ICC's
jurisdiction gives them longer and
more peaceful terms in office. If an international criminal
court--including, but not limited to,
the ICC--indicts them, however, their chance of losing office
increases greatly. If they insist on
remaining in power, both the state's receipt of development capital
and its domestic production
tumble. These courts' indictments prove to be more consequential
than other public reports about
prosecutable human-rights abuses ostensibly committed by the
leader's administration. The ICC's
power is real, but it has gaps, politicizing the expansion of its
jurisdiction.","CONTENTS -- 1 Introduction 1 -- 1.1 International criminal courts

published,emory:crcwm,"Lopez Bao, Orosman","Fraying at the Edges: Male Homosexuals, Female Prostitutes, and
Suicides in Cuba's Post-Soviet Detective Fiction","This study examines the portrayal of male homosexuals,
female prostitutes, and suicides in Cuban society in representative
works of Cuban detective fiction of the post-Soviet period. I have
methodologically relied on close readings of Leonardo Padura
Fuentes's MÃ¡scaras (1997), Amir
Valle Ojeda's Las puertas de la noche (2001),
and Lorenzo Lunar CardedoÂ´s Polvo en el
viento (2005) to gauge the extent to which Cuban writers
of this genre have attempted to renegotiate the place of these
figures in Cuba's civic life after 1989. As sites of abjection, the
male homosexual, the female prostitute, and the suicide figured
prominently in Cuban nationalist discourse during its formative
period in the nineteenth century and beyond. Relying on the
theoretical work of Julia Kristeva on the nature of the abject, I
submit that -as sites of abjection- these figures became at a
critical juncture the boundaries of what would eventually become
the Cuban republic. In this manner they are intrinsically a part of
the nation's self-understanding. I contend that the economic
hardships and ideological contradictions that Cubans experienced
during the country's ""Special Period in Times of Peace"" threatened
the nation's identity to such a degree that it prompted a
reevaluation of the abject boundaries these figures
represented.","Table of Contents --

doing theology. In the first chapter, I claim that divine

Chapter 2 traces conciliar developments, from Nicaea to Chalcedon,
that clarify Christian speech about Jesus, including affirmation of
his two natures and his divine identity. Chapter 3 continues on
this historical bent, identifying the Iconoclast controversy as a
further discussion concerning Jesus' identity as the

published,emory:7t42k,"Larson, Jacqueline ",Attachment Style and Values in Young Adult Friendships,"Past research indicates that close friendships are crucial for
psychosocial health and well-being. To better understand these
important young adult relationships, this study examined young
adult friendships in the context of attachment theory and value
similarity. Fifty friend pairs were surveyed on their values,
attachment style, and friendship quality. Results indicated that
generally perceived, but not actual, value similarity is important
for maintaining low conflict and high depth within friendships.
Friendship quality generally did not differ by attachment style,
but there were two interactions suggesting that attachment style
moderates the relationship between value similarity and friendship
quality. This study concluded that perceived value similarity is
important for high-quality friendships, and that although
friendships typically are not attachment relationships, attachment
style may still impact friendship functioning.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Friendship as an Attachment

PROBLEMS
by
Raya Horesh

In this thesis we develop numerical methods for the solution of
large-scale PDE-based constrained optimization problems. Overall
three studies
are presented; the first two are application driven, addressing
volume preserving image registration and optimal mass transport
problems. The third
study is more generic and embarks at the development of a new
inexact sequential quadratic programming framework. Image
registration aims at
finding a plausible transformation which aligns images taken at
different times, different view-points or by different modalities.
This problem is ill-
posed and therefore, regularization is required. In that study,
elastic regularizer is considered along with volume preserving
constraint. A numerical
framework based on augmented Lagrangian along with geometrical
multi-grid preconditioner was devised. The proposed algorithm was
tested with
real data. The optimal mass transport seeks for an optimal way to
move a pile of soil from one site to another using minimal energy,
while preserving
the overall mass. In that study, a fluid dynamics formulation was
considered. This formulation introduces an artificial time
stepping, which on the
one hand transforms the non-convex problem to a convex one, but on
the other hand increases the dimensionality of the problem. A Schur
comple-
ment and algebraic multigrid formed a preconditioner within a
sequential quadratic programming scheme. Results for both three and
four dimensional
problems were presented. Inside each step of nonlinear
optimization, solution for an ill-conditioned, indefinite linear
system, known as a KKT system
is required. As problem size increases, linear iterative solvers
become the bottleneck of the optimization scheme. In the third
study, a new approach
for inexact step computation is proposed. The general idea is to
reduce the number of linear iteration while still maintaining
convergence of the overall
scheme. This is done, by the embedment of a filter inside a linear
solver.","1 Introduction 8 -- 1 Image Registration - Problem Statement . . .

published,emory:d953z,"Sekar, Swathi","The association of caregivers' access to Anganwadi Center
services with school readiness of their 5-year old children: A
secondary cross-sectional analysis of data from Chhattisgarh,
India","Background: School readiness is the component of early
childhood development that is focused on early childhood education
(ECE) and preparing the child for formal schooling. In India, early
childhood care and education (ECCE) is almost entirely provided by
the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) system through a
system of Anganwadi Centers (AWCs). Early Childhood Development
(ECD) programs with built-in health components, incorporating
family-based services and home visiting programs show promise in
improving school readiness.
Objective: Explore whether caregiver's access to AWC
services is associated with school readiness scores, including
literacy and numeracy scores, of children between 5-5.5 years.
Methods: The target population for this analysis
consisted of caregivers with children aged 5-5.5 years, resulting
in a sample size of 1248. A stratified two stage clustered sampling
procedure was used. These data were analyzed in a cross sectional
design. Composite scores for the different components of school
readiness (numeracy, literacy and adaptive behavior) were created.
Nine variables were selected that exemplify various aspects of
health services through Anganwadi centers and were combined into a
single score for access to services.
Results: Overall school readiness score ranged from 8 to
70 with an average of 43.4. Certain AWC service such as mothers
registering their pregnancy, mothers receiving TT vaccinations, and
receiving supplementary nutrition showed associations with improved
school readiness in the overall score and the adaptive behavior
score. Conversely, some services such as those who had a village
health and nutrition day organized in their village or mothers who
had a health worker visit her home during her pregnancy, were
associated with worse school readiness scores.
Discussion: Our data provide evidence to say that
caregiver's access to AWC services is associated with school
readiness scores of their 5 year old children. However, while some
services had a positive association with school readiness, as
expected, others had no association or even more surprisingly, a
negative association. This could be due to individuals with lower
health indicators seeking out these services, or people in the
community being unaware of the AWC services.","-- Table of Contents -- 1. Introduction 1 -- 1.1 Rationale 1 -- 1.2

Culture of the Academic Library
","What does it mean, when academic libraries are noisy? After
centuries of silence, bound up in architecture, building use
policies, and scholarly habits, the American academic library is
experiencing abrupt changes in its soundscape as shifts in
technology and pedagogy prompt its re-situation in the academic
community. Librarians, facing a future in which the role and
relevancy of the library is uncertain, argue for its continued
validity by linking changes in the library to its educational
mission and to the needs and preferences of students born in the
Digital Age. Lifelong library users, though acquiescing to these
changes, question their appropriateness to the library's essential
role. Conflicts over the meaning of the academic library bespeak
broader challenges in American higher education over balancing
support for the life of the mind with the demands of a
consumer-driven academic culture.
Focused on American academic libraries in general and Emory
University's Woodruff Library in particular, this phenomenological
and ethnographic case study explores the meaning of the library to
members of the academic community as a way of assessing the
legitimacy of new library spaces. Using theories of discourse and
sociological theories of legitimacy, methods of cultural and
linguistic anthropology, and a historical and experiential focus on
the soundscape of the library, this interdisciplinary research
gauges the divergence between users' beliefs about and use of the
library and the types of spaces and activities promoted by
librarians. In discourse about and observations within libraries,
differing expectations of the role of the library emerge, along
with a process of legitimating new library spaces by connecting
them to broader cultural frameworks and extant beliefs regarding
the role of the library. Beyond evidencing the library's expanding
technological and pedagogical roles, the soundscape of the academic
library signals a deeper shift in the nature of academic life -
from the culture of isolated reflection that has long typified the
life of the mind, to a new academic culture of productivity, in
which a focus on efficiency, outcomes, and consumer demands drive
the experience of higher education.","CHAPTER 1 THE SOUND OF CHANGE IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES 1 -- STATEMENT

A Summary of Research on the Topology of the Universe
By Sara Lykken

On June 30, 2001 NASA launched its Wilkinson Microwave
Ansiotropy
Probe (WMAP) to study the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
radi-
ation, radiation from the plasma that filled the universe until
just 380,000
years after the Big Bang. The information collected by the WMAP
satellite
provides clues as to the universe's topology. Specifically, early
WMAP data
suggested the near disappearance of temperature fluctuations in the
CMB ra-
diation on large angular scales, going completely against what was
predicted
by an infinite Euclidean model for the universe. Researchers
attempted to
explain the missing large-scale fluctuations by suggesting the
possibility of a
small, finite-volume universe. Observations about the local
geometry of our
universe suggest a spherical, Euclidean or hyperbolic universe and,
primar-
ily for reasons of practicality, research has focused on spherical
3-manifolds.
Comparing observed fluctuations in the CMB radiation to those
predicted
by various spherical spaces, some advocate the Poincare
dodecahedral space
as a model for our universe. Recently, however, new data has been
released
that may weaken the case for the dodecahedral space. This paper
seeks to
explain and expand upon these topological investigations with the
intention
of making them accessible to a wider audience, in order to
facilitate dialogue
with specialists in other relevant areas.","Contents -- 1

published,emory:gsj6j,"Philyaw, Meredith L.",Do Adults with a Childhood Abuse History Delay Preventive Care?,"Timely preventive care by adults with a childhood abuse
history is critical, given their elevated risk of chronic
conditions which benefit from early detection. Yet, adults with a
childhood abuse history may face unique psychological and
psychosocial barriers to preventive care and evidence of how this
population uses preventive care is limited.
Using data collected from
23,830 participants in five states that administered the 2010 BRFSS
Adverse Childhood Experiences module, I examined whether adults
with a self-reported history of recurrent childhood physical,
sexual or emotional abuse reported receiving six preventive
services (breast/cervical/prostate/colorectal cancer screenings,
HIV tests, and dental cleanings) according to recommended
guidelines for disease prevention and early detection. Two
additional preventive services, flu vaccines and routine check-ups,
were modeled as counterfactuals to illustrate that childhood abuse
history selectively impacts preventive care, independent of common
barriers to timely preventive care among vulnerable
populations.
Multivariate weighted results indicate that women with a
childhood abuse history were significantly less likely than women
without a childhood abuse history to report receiving a timely
breast cancer screening. I also found that, among adults at-risk
for HIV, those with a childhood abuse history were less likely to
report receiving an annual HIV test until further adjustment for
HIV testing site. Adults with a childhood abuse history did not
differ from adults without a childhood abuse history in their
timely utilization of the remaining preventive services or the
counterfactuals.
My findings suggest that adults with a childhood abuse history
selectively delay preventive care. Identifying the mechanism(s)
driving delayed breast cancer screening among this population is
critical for attenuating their greater likelihood of late-stage
breast cancer diagnoses. Further, since adults with a childhood
abuse history regularly use trauma-reminding preventive services,
it is important that providers are aware of sensitive practices
when administering these procedures to affected individuals. Future
studies are needed which examine the value of care used by adults
with a childhood abuse history to inform strategies for slowing the
economic impact of this high-need population on the U.S. healthcare
system.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Literature Review 4 --

Stigma in a Community in Northern Thailand","HIV-related stigma is a complex phenomenon that affects different
stakeholders in different ways and at different levels. Both people
living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and the community are affected by
stigma, albeit in different ways. In Thailand, instrumental stigma,
i.e. fear of infection, is more common than symbolic stigma, i.e.
negative attitudes toward PLWHA, because behaviors associated with
HIV are not stigmatized behaviors in Thailand. Social status is
likely to influence susceptibility to instrumental stigma in
Thailand. In terms of socioeconomic status, less powerful
individuals seem to be more vulnerable to stigma and its
consequences than the more powerful. Instrumental HIV-related
stigma in Thailand can also be present in the form of
resource-based stigma especially in communities with limited
resources. In summary, HIV-related stigma in Thailand can be
characterized as arising from fear of infection and influenced by
socioeconomic power. A multi-level intervention program is proposed
in this special study project to reduce HIV-related stigma and
ultimately improve the quality of life of PLWHA. Hope House, a
faith-based organization in Northern Thailand, and Wang Tao
village, the neighboring community of Hope House, are the chosen
site where the program will be implemented. The program aims to
reduce internalized stigma in PLWHA residents of Hope House by
increasing their self-esteem and to decrease instrumental stigma in
the community by means of an education program. By empowering PLWHA
residents to the level of self- reliance, it should also lessen the
degree of resource-based stigma in PLWHAs and people in the
community. An HIV/AIDS education program that increases the
opportunity for community members to interact with PLWHAs is also
envisaged to reduce instrumental stigma. Activities that encourage
communication between people in the community and PLWHA residents
should reduce stigma in both groups and thus improve the quality of
life in PLWHA residents of Hope House.","-- Table of Contents -- CHAPTER 1:

Century Malabar, India","This dissertation explores the historical trajectories of the
different
forms of knowledge production in the colonial context analyzing
the
community reform movements of two caste communities in twentieth
century
Malabar in India. Through a comparative historical study, the
work
investigates how Asaris (the carpenter caste) and Brahmins (the
priestly caste)
of Malabar, in their attempt to reform the community, differently
negotiated
with the colonial practices of production of knowledge. In this
analysis, I mark
the activities in the dominant field of knowledge both in the
colonies and in
post-colonies as production of knowledge and the
embodied actions of
knowing outside the dominant field as practices of
knowing. The major
objective of the study is to trace the tension between production
of knowledge
and practices of knowing by analyzing their interface both in the
colonial and
post-colonial situations.
Asaris in the first half of the twentieth century assimilated the
new
materials and the new social relations emerged through colonialism
into the
fold of Asari world without entering into the order of knowledge.
They
avoided colonial interventions in their practices by keeping
asarippani
(carpentry) a practice of knowing. By the last decades of the
twentieth century,
general socio-economical changes in the region and technological
changes in
the construction field forced Asaris to incorporate elements of
'modern
knowledge' which transformed asarippani into a new form. By the end
of the
twentieth century asarippani moved into an overlapping field of
production of
knowledge and practice of knowing. Nampoothiris, through the
reform
movement during the second quarter of the twentieth century,
attempted to
establish a continuity between the 'traditional' Brahmanical
knowledge and
'modern' scientific knowledge. The dissertation shows that the
specific way in
which colonialists conceptualized knowledge, enabled Nampoothiris
to enter
into the order of knowledge maintaining the dominance in the
society. The
comparative analysis of production of knowledge and practice of
knowing
contributes to a politics which challenge the homogenizing
tendencies in the
contemporary institutional practices of knowledge. The dissertation
also
demonstrates and underscores the possibilities of different ways of
knowing
and being in this world.","Content -- Introduction -- Chapter 1: An Asari world of Knowing --

American attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Using the 2010 General
Social Survey, a
nationally representative sample of adults in the United States, I
quantify the effects of sex, race,

largely replicate past research. In a
final ordinary least squares regression analysis, political
ideology, frequency of religious service
attendance, age, educational attainment, race, sex, and total
household income are found to be
the strongest predictors of gay marriage attitude, in that order.
The implications of the findings
for social science and social policy are discussed.","Table of Contents -- Introduction 1 -- Literature Review 5 --

suggested that repetition
leads to desensitization, that if one witnesses the same images and
ideas over and over, they are
subject to losing their novelty. Although I agree there is validity
to this claim, is there also
something more mystical to the idea of repetition? This collection
explores the question at hand,
creating a narrative out of a series of pairs, each of which
touches upon repeated images, ideas,
words and phrases that are manifested in the life of the speaker,
art, myth, and a more fantasy-
based, metaphorical world. Over the course of the collection, I
have delved into concepts such as
death, destruction, love, fears, impulses, desires and creation,
since these demonstrate those
repetitive facets of human existence that are universal and
therefore some of the most present.
Through a seamless interplay of repetition between these pairs, the
poems serve to blur the lines
that exist between art, dream and reality. In turn, they suggest
that the omnipresent nature of
repetition across time and space has the power to render a feeling
of entrapment, and therefore,
to a certain degree, a heightened sensitivity rather than a
desensitization. Thus, as a whole, the
collection aims to ask a more overarching question: in the quest to
free oneself from the
repetitive patterns of existence, where might a person find
solace?","Warhol's Green Car Crash Sells for a Record $71.7 Mil at Christie's

published,emory:fzkvk,"Westbeld Gallois, Gina E.","Original Copies: Rousseau, Laclos, Stendhal","True originality is, perhaps, the offspring of superior
imitation. The practice of imitation as a rite of passage and a
show of mastery has a long history in literature. My interest in
the concept of copying lies more with internal questions at the
level of diegesis and the text than with the external concept of
influence; notably ways in which, for instance, Rousseau's Julie
ou la nouvelle
Héloïse is
explicitly read though two later novels, Laclos's Les
Liaisons dangereuses and Stendhal's Le Rouge et
le Noir and the complex mechanisms at work in scenes in
which some form of copying, transcribing and/or imitation takes
place. By analyzing key scenes of ""copying"" as mise en
abyme for the process of literary creation, I will
evaluate the status of the copy in general and how these novels
""copy"" through an explicit dialog with their predecessors,
transcribing their readings into a nonetheless new and original
text, affirming their own place in the novelistic tradition.
Explicit scenes of copying comment implicitly on the very
imitations they are performing. Rousseau's title and basic plot
make overt reference to the legendary love story of
Abélard and
Héloïse. In
Liaisons, Merteuil claims that Rousseau is the only
novelist capable of expressing love convincingly as she criticizes
Valmont's efforts to seduce the
Présidente by feigning love through
writing. In Le Rouge et le Noir, Julien is
drawn into a roman par lettres when Mathilde
tosses love letters to him at his desk, harkening back to
Julie and Liaisons. Stendhal's
novel emerges in the early 19th century
proposing, not the ultimate novel of ""psychological realism,"" as
has sometimes been suggested, but the possibility of an escape from
the copying and imitation so pervasive in worldly Parisian society.
Paradoxically, it is through silence that Julien and Mme de
Rênal seem to reclaim a kind of
sincere moment of bonheur from the well meaning
but unstable utopian systems imagined in Julie
and from the cynical suggestion of the impossibility of
Valmont's famous suppressed love letter to the
Présidente.","-- Introduction: Mastery Through Imitation --

(ASK) 1 and 2 Signalosomes","Mechanisms Controlling the
Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinases (ASK) 1 and 2
Signalosomes
By Lisa Montoya Cockrell
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades transmit
biological signals to
elicit cellular responses. Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase (ASK)
1 is a tightly
regulated MAP3K whose activation results in stress responses,
including cell death. The
ASK1 signalosome represents the collection of proteins which both
regulate and direct
ASK1 activation and suppression. ASK2 is a newly defined member of
the ASK1
signalosome. In this dissertation, it was discovered that (i) ASK2
directs the suppression
of ASK1 through engagement of the cell regulatory protein 14-3-3;
and (ii) ASK2
interaction with ASK1 is required for 14-3-3-mediated suppression.
It was shown that
ASK2 directly binds to 14-3-3, through a phosphorylation-regulated
interaction mapped
to serine 964 of ASK2. ASK1, ASK2, and 14-3-3 exist in a specific
ternary complex
dynamically controlled by phosphorylation. A 14-3-3 binding
defective mutation in
ASK2 greatly diminished the amount of ASK1 in the 14-3-3 complex.
Through
dissociation of 14-3-3, ASK1 becomes activated, evidenced both by a
decrease in
phosphorylation of serine 967 and an increase in downstream
activation of the c-Jun N-
terminal kinase. Inhibition of the ASK1/ASK2 interaction
dramatically decreased the
amount of ASK1 in the 14-3-3 complex, confirming the importance of
ASK2 in directing
14-3-3-mediated ASK1 suppression. This research has identified a
novel mechanism
controlling signal relay between the two MAP3Ks ASK1 and ASK2, and
suggests a
model whereby upstream signaling events couple ASK2 serine 964
phosphorylation to
the ASK1 signalosome, through dual engagement of 14-3-3
proteins.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Chapter 1. -- Introduction and Background -- 1

or Promotion Affects Gender Earnings Disparities","While professionals change employers more frequently since the
1970s, inter-organizational mobility is associated with greater
earnings increases for men than for women. As people in
organizations make employment and pay decisions, this dissertation
examines how organizational practices affect gender disparities
among hired and promoted employees. I draw on organizational
literature and conduct a longitudinal, mixed-methods case study of
careers in a large U.S. employer (""B2G""). I rely on longitudinal
personnel records (2005-2013) and 19 in-depth interviews with
supervisors to address how organizations set hired and promoted
employees' pay, how job entry modes affect gender disparities at
entry and over time, and how we can explain these patterns.
The analyses yield two important yet surprising findings.
At job entry, men earn significantly more than women do. This gap
is equally wide among hired and promoted employees, meaning gender
differences in starting salaries are independent of job entry mode.
Although previous research suggests that opportunities for
disparate treatment at job entry are greater among hired than
promoted employees, interviews with supervisors suggest that B2G
goes to great length to ensure equitable starting salaries,
possibly minimizing discretion in the hiring process.
After job entry, gender earnings disparities widen among
hired employees but remain constant among promoted employees.
Disparities do not emerge because of selective turnover or
infrequent raises, but because hired women receive smaller pay
increases than hired men do. In contrast, promoted men and women
receive the same increases. Performance evaluations only partially
account for widening gender disparities among hired employees. As
interviews revealed greater supervisory discretion over post-entry
pay increases, widening gender gaps might result from
organizational processes. These results highlight the importance of
examining mobility outcomes beyond the point of job
entry.
This dissertation lays the foundation for an
organizational perspective on gender disparities in mobility
outcomes. To understand why and when inter- and
intra-organizational job mobility translates into gender earnings
gaps, we have to consider how organizations distribute rewards.
Hence, above individual differences, organizational practice may
determine how entering a job via hire or promotion affects men and
women.","Chapter 1.

Hierarchical Hanoi Networks","Despite all the remarkable breakthroughs in the area of complex
networks over the last two decades, there still lacks a complete
and general understanding of effects that occur when long-range
connections are present in a system. This thesis explores the Ising
model using recursive hierarchical networks called Hanoi networks
(HN) as a substrate. Hanoi networks are purely synthetic and are
not found in nature, so it is important to establish and not lose
sight of why they worth studying. In essence, we are not strictly
interested in HNs themselves, but the generalized statements about
phase transitions on complex networks that they provide via the
renormalization group (RG).
The RG framework on HNs is established in this study and the
thermodynamic observables for statistical models are derived from
it. Traditionally, the RG has given physicists insight into the
critical exponents of a system or model, which leads to universal
behavior; however, hyperbolic networks, like the ones currently
under investigation, do not contain constant exponents and do not
exhibit universality. Instead, it is found that the scaling
exponents are functions of the temperature. We ultimately want to
answer the questions: What is it about long-range connections that
create a break in universal behavior and can complex networks be
designed to produce predicted and intended effects in phase
behavior? The current state of research is several years or perhaps
decades away from fully comprehending the answers to these
questions. The research presented here is motivated by these
questions, and our contribution here is intended to show a
generalized picture of phase transitions on networks.","I INTRODUCTION -- 1.1 Phases of Matter -- 1.2 Phase Transitions --

published,emory:gjr24,"Dash, Chiranjeev",Oxidative Balance and Colorectal Neoplasms,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), a multifactorial disease, is the
second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. Preventive
approaches aimed at specific, known pathways of CRC causation, such
as oxidative stress, might be effective in reducing CRC morbidity
and mortality. Although oxidative stress is implicated in
colorectal carcinogenesis, human studies that evaluated
associations of individual pro- and antioxidants with CRC have been
inconclusive. The goals for this dissertation were to
develop, compare and evaluate comprehensive ""oxidative balance
scores (OBS)"", comprised of individual dietary, and environmental
exposures that are known to affect physiologic oxidative processes,
and to investigate the association of oxidative balance with risk
of colorectal neoplasms and biomarkers of oxidative
stress.
Four OBS were created to reflect combined summary measures of
dietary and non-dietary anti- and pro-oxidant exposures. A higher
score represents a predominance of anti- over pro-oxidant
exposures. In a pooled analysis of three colonoscopy-based
case-control studies, a substantial, statistically significant
lower risk of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas was found with
higher levels of OBS. The results also suggested a dose dependent
decrease in F2-isoprostanes, a sensitive and specific marker of
oxidative stress in vivo, with increasing levels of OBS,
providing support for OBS as a valid measure of oxidative balance.
In a large prospective cohort study, higher OBS were associated
with lower risk of CRC. In a biomarker-based pooled analysis of two
case-control studies of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas,
results suggested that lipid peroxidation, as indicated by
circulating F2-isoprostanes, may be 1) positively associated with
risk for incident, sporadic colorectal adenoma in women, but not
men, and 2) inversely associated with antioxidant micronutrient
exposures, with some differences according to sex.
In conclusion, I introduced three novel methods for constructing
OBS in this dissertation. Results of this dissertation support the
use of pathway exposure scores to measure complex multicomponent
exposures, provide evidence to suggest that oxidative balance is
strongly associated with colorectal adenoma and cancer incidence,
and support further investigations of oxidative balance with other
chronic diseases. My dissertation also provides a framework for the
development of oxidative balance-based interventions to reduce
colorectal cancer risk.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- ILLUSTRATIONS -- LIST OF TABLES -- CHAPTER 1.

LIANG SHANG
The membrane-spanning domain (MSD) of the human immunodeficiency
viruses type I
(HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) is critical for its biological
activities. In this
dissertation, genetic approaches are used to study the structural
and functional roles of
the MSD in viral replication. By examining a series of C-terminal
truncation mutants of
HIV-1 gp41, we show that the entire MSD is required for normal Env
incorporation and
viral infection. In contrast, a region of 17 residues (K681 to
A698) is sufficient to stably
anchor the protein in the membrane, allow efficient transport to
the plasma membrane,
and mediate WT levels of cell-cell fusion. Truncation to the
residues that are N-terminal
to F697 resulted in an Env complex that was secreted from the
cells. Based on the
analysis of these mutants, a ""snorkeling"" model is proposed for the
structure of HIV-1
MSD. In this model, the 12 residues (L682-L693) form an
intramembrane helical ""core""
and the flanking residues K681 and R694 are buried in the lipid
while their side chains
interact with polar head groups. In order to understand roles of
the highly conserved
hydrophobic residues and glycine motifs in the MSD ""core"", we
constructed recovery-of-
function mutants by initially replacing the ""core"" with 12 leucine
residues and then
reintroducing the specific residues. We show here that conservation
of the MSD core
sequence is not required for normal expression, processing,
intracellular transport, and
viral incorporation of HIV-1 Env. However, specific residues in the
MSD do play a critical
role in the Env-mediated virus-cell fusion and subsequent viral
infection by modulating
conformational integrity of the Env ectodomain. Substitutions in
the MSD ""core"" result in
several minor and localized conformational changes in gp120 and the
gp41 ectodomain.
These conformational changes impair initiation of the early events
that are required for
formation of the 6-helix bundle and subsequent fusion pores; while
they does not
influence the specific virus-cell attachment, nor the recognition
of HIV-1 Env to the CD4
receptor and CXCR4 coreceptor.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- page --

Mapping and Analyzing Breakpoints of a Recurrent Translocation
Between Chromosomes 8 and 12

The recurrent translocation between chromosomes 8 and 12 is
responsible for a novel syndrome and its phenotypic
characteristics, which include intellectual disability, seizures,
macrocephaly, eczema, and obesity. This translocation, which
results in trisomy for part of chromosome 12p and monosomy for part
of 8p, is mediated by the presence of segmental duplication
regions, or regions of highly repetitive sequence between the two
chromosomes. Additionally, one of the genes present in this section
of 12p, of which there is an extra copy in this translocation, is
GNB3, which codes for a G protein subunit and has been found
to be an obesity candidate gene. In this research, I worked to map
the breakpoint junction sites for seven unrelated patients
previously diagnosed with this recurrent unbalanced translocation.
I also outline the difficulties inherent to the project, as the
breakpoint junctions lie within regions of highly repetitive
sequence, and are therefore difficult to capture. Furthermore, I
discuss future plans to study the mRNA expression of GNB3 in
a mouse model of this translocation as a future project.","Table of Contents -- Index of Figures i -- Chapter 1: Background 1

An Exploration of The Lover
By Lia Marianes

The goal of this thesis was to explore, through the performance of
my adaptation of The Lover by Marguerite Duras, the
interplay between memory and the factual reality of events, to
discover the responsibilities of an adaptor and an actor in a
potentially autobiographical work, and to use a new piece of
theater to cause audiences to examine the impactful events of their
own lives. Additionally, with over 70 published plays, novel, and
screenplays, Marguerite Duras was one of the most prolific modern
French writers, and yet she remains relatively unknown in the
United States. Therefore, another of the project's goals was to
introduce Duras to American academics. I also intended to further
Duras' established tradition of cross-discipline production through
the adaptation of The Lover into a play.
The research questions I pursued centered on the interplay
between memory and reality in Duras' work. The novel was written in
1984 when Duras was an old woman, and yet is about a time in her
life of enormous youthful exuberance growth, and change; this
raises the question of whether this is autobiography, fiction, or
both. Duras wrote several accounts of this story (The
North China Lover, Wartime Writings, Eden Cinema, The Sea Wall), and the account of that lover
and her relationship with him is entirely different in each
retelling. Therefore, what of the novel belongs to fact, and what
to fiction? Additionally, what is the adaptor's responsibility to
represent fact in a fictional, potentially autobiographical, work?
This question had an impact on me as the adaptor of the piece, as I
too had a responsibility to the text. To answer these questions, I
explored Duras' life and her fiction, as well as the existing
criticism on her oeuvre, through dramaturgy. I then applied the
dramaturgy to the adaptation and rehearsal process to create a
theatrical production of The Lover that was firmly rooted in
research.","Table of Contents -- Chapter One-The Dramaturgical Protocol -- 1 --

Virus","Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important
pathogen underlying acute lower respiratory tract infections in
infants. Currently there are no vaccines or antivirals.
Understanding the functions of RSV virulence genes should provide
new insights into development of vaccines and
antivirals.
Two non-structural genes of RSV (NS1 and NS2) suppress the
host immune responses. Deletion of either or both NS genes
generated virus that was either under-attenuated or over-attenuated
for an effective and safe vaccine candidate for infants and young
children. We used a codon deoptimization strategy to reduce the
expression of NS genes based on human codon usage bias, resulting
in dNSh virus. dNSh was attenuated in BEAS-2B and primary normal
human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface,
but not in Vero or HEp-2 cells. In BALB/c mice, dNSh exhibited
10-fold lower viral load yet induced higher levels of
RSV-neutralizing antibodies than the A2 non-deoptimized virus. Both
viruses induced the same protection efficacy against challenge
strains A/1997/12-35 and A2-line19F. Upon codon deoptimization, the
NS target protein, STAT2, was degraded to a lesser extent than
infection with non-deoptimized virus. dNSh induced less
NF-ÎºB activation, suggesting less pro-inflammatory
potential. Serial passages in BEAS-2B did not generate nucleotide
changes in the deoptimized regions.
    RSV strain differences are
an important factor in pathogenesis. The two surface glycoproteins,
attachment protein G and fusion protein F, play major functions
during infection. Previous studies indicated G protein was not
required for infection, based on the fact that G-null virus still
replicates efficiently in several cell-lines. We re-evaluated the
functions of the G gene for a clinical isolate A2001/2-20 (2-20) in
comparison to the lab strain A2. We generated recombinant viruses
containing G and F or no G protein from either A2 (kRSV-A2G-A2F and
kRSV-GstopA2F) or 2-20 strains (kRSV-2-20G-2-20F and
kRSV-Gstop2-20F). We quantified the contribution of G to virus
binding, entry kinetics, infectivity, and replication in
vitro. Removal of 2-20 G from the virus had more deleterious
effects than removal of A2 G in all the above processes. Overall,
the 2-20 strain F had a higher dependence on its G protein than did
the A2 strain.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION - AN OVERVIEW OF

of Breast Cancer in Austria","Objective: This study explores the relationship
between the perceived impact of cancer among long-term breast
cancer survivors, key socio-demographic and clinical variables, and
mental and physical health-related quality of life outcomes in
Austria.
Methods: One hundred and fifty-two long-term survivors of
breast cancer (on average 13 years after initial diagnosis)
completed three mailed surveys including the SF-36 to determine
self-reported mental and physical health functioning, the Impact of
Cancer (version 2) to assess the perceived positive and negative
aspects of long-term cancer survivorship, and a general
questionnaire to gather socio-demographic and clinical variables of
respondents. Linear regression models were constructed to determine
the various effects of the perceived positive and negative impact
of cancer, while controlling for additional socio-demographic and
clinical variables, on mental and physical health-related quality
of life.
Results: Respondents reported a physical health status
that centered on population norms for Austria, but scored lower on
mental health status. After controlling for age, chemotherapy,
exercise, and BMI, the positive impact of cancer was associated
with improved physical functioning (p=0.0014), and the negative
impact of cancer was associated with poorer physical functioning
(p&lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, marital status, the
belief in emotional distress as a cause of cancer, and high stress
levels, the negative impact of cancer was associated with poorer
mental functioning (p&lt;0.0001). Higher perceived positive impact
of cancer was not associated with mental functioning.
Conclusion: Long-term survivors of breast cancer in
Austria perceive both positive and negative impacts of breast
cancer. These perceptions, in particular the negative impact of
cancer, appear to influence, or are potentially influenced by,
physical and mental health-related quality of life.","Table of Contents -- I. Background 3 -- II. Methods 8 -- III.

International Student Identity and Student Work Values.","The overwhelming influx of international students into the
United States has attracted great attention in the past few
decades. Yet existing studies mainly focused on the macro level of
cross cultural relationships and international connections. Few
scholars examined the micro level of interactions between
international and domestic students. Even fewer examined value
differences. My research intended to study the variance in work
values created by students' identity. In other words, I examined
whether being an international student influences one's values
towards work and career preference. I utilized Schwartz's theory on
work values and divided them into four aspects: intrinsic,
extrinsic, social and power. Schwartz's theory is widely referenced
and is closely connected with his basic human values. Having
conducted two surveys and four supplementary interviews, my
research data refuted the popular notion that international
students' value different dramatically from those of domestic
students'. Both demographic groups rated intrinsic and power values
similarly, and showed variance on extrinsic and social values. With
the help of my interview field notes and other scholarly journals,
I was able to offer several plausible factors for these results.
Among them the admission process was crucial for that it gathered
students from similar backgrounds and with similar values together.
Meanwhile, cultural factor still plays its role in demographical
differences, but data has proved that the difference is not as
dramatic as we expected. This research is limited to the context of
Emory University, and further study with more longitudinal data
will certainly strengthen my theories. The value of my research
lies in that it offers the educational institution with a new
perspective: international students' values are similar to domestic
students' on certain dimensions. This counterintuitive finding
provides a new direction for campus policy and fosters a new
understanding on diversity.","Table of Contents -- 1. Overview -- 1.1 International Student

and Outcomes of the Clinical Evaluation and Management Process for
Medicare Beneficiaries with Chronic Conditions","This dissertation explores the trade-off between patient
continuity of care and physician division of labor in ambulatory
care of older adults with chronic conditions. It does so in the
context of ongoing innovation in the organization, delivery, and
payment of physician services in the United States. The physician
evaluation and management office visit is the setting in the health
care system where physicians routinely perform the core clinical
tasks of patient diagnosis, treatment, referral, and follow-up. The
challenge is performing the core clinical tasks for diverse
patients with complex care needs and shared with multiple providers
over time. The challenge is even greater for older adults with
chronic conditions who are especially reliant on regular
guideline-concordant care to maintain their functional status and
quality of life. As a result, I take the clinical evaluation and
management process and associated patient and physician inputs,
outputs, and outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes
and/or heart failure as my foci.
For a nationally representative population of Medicare
fee-for-service beneficiaries with diabetes and/or heart failure I
find that division of labor between primary care and specialist
physicians exerts a clear benefit for increasing provision of
guideline-concordant medical care and for preventing future adverse
health outcomes and hospitalization. This benefit exists in spite
of the corresponding loss in observed patient continuity of care.
In addition, I find the largest benefit for specialized physician
involvement that is the most disease-relevant.
The most important implication of this research is that it is
critical for Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions such as
diabetes and heart failure to have at least one annual evaluation
and management visit with a disease-relevant specialist, in
addition to annual involvement with a primary care physician.
Medicare policy makers should consider how to incentivize scheduled
annual involvement of disease-relevant specialists for
beneficiaries with complex chronic conditions. Lastly, to the
extent that the current trend toward physician affiliation with
multi-specialty group practices leads to more shared management of
patients with chronic conditions by primary care and specialist
physicians, the result predicted by this study is improved quality
of care and better health outcomes.","--  -- 1. Introduction and Background

approved,emory:pmpmg,"Goodman, Glen Skiles","From ""German Danger"" to German-Brazilian President: Immigration,
ethnicity, and the making of Brazilian identities, 1924-1974","The arrival of tens of thousands of German-speakers to Brazil's
shores in the 19th and early 20th centuries
in part realized the dream of many among the intellectual and
political elite. They imagined German and other immigrants embody
cultural and eugenic traits that would help resolve a host of
Brazil's problems, from issues of land tenure to fears of racial
""degeneracy."" The immigrants themselves did as immigrants the world
over: forged communities and lifeways that drew on pre-migratory
experience while responding to and shaping their new contexts.
Tectonic shifts in politics and society during the 1930s and 40s
engendered reinterpretations of what constituted Brazilian
identity; a new and state-sponsored Brazilianness recast what had
previously been considered the nation's problems as its strengths.
Consequently, the various ethnicities that had arisen as a
consequence of mass European and Asian migrations--in particular,
Germans--emerged as an internal other, at once in Brazil but
dangerously not of Brazil. This presented German-Brazilians
with a radically altered landscape within which to assert both
national belonging and ethnic difference. However, within a
generation the ground had shifted again and Germanness reemerged
under the military dictatorship as one possible, idealized sort of
Brazilianness.
This dissertation traces the shifting meanings and
understandings of Germanness in Brazil at various junctures from
the 1924 centenary of German migrants' first arrival in southern
Brazil to the sesquicentenary celebrations in 1974. It demonstrates
the ways that various historical actors shaped Germanness as both a
set of traits and practices and as a rhetorical identity discourse.
In so doing, this dissertation reveals the stakes of ethnicity for
self-identifying German-Brazilians and for others. At various
historical junctures in mid-twentieth century Brazil, ethnicity
variously helped or hindered a host of diverse political
projects--most consequentially the consolidation of official
discourses of Brazilian identity. As this analysis demonstrates,
during the fifty years in question and in the minds of many
Brazilians, Germanness transitioned from a positive quality of a
national ""other"" to an existential internal threat to an idealized
aspect of Brazilianness.","Contents -- List of Tables -- List of Figures -- Introduction 1 --

Kollwitz's A Weavers' Rebellion (1893-97)","This honors thesis examines a cycle, or series of images,
entitled A Weavers' Rebellion (Ein Weberaufstand,
1893-97) by Käthe Kollwitz, a German nineteenth- and
twentieth-century draftsman, printmaker, and sculptor. Research on
Kollwitz has been relatively limited, particularly in recent years,
and most scholars consider her work within a reductively feminist
paradigm, interpreting her art in ways that emphasize her
biography, motherhood, and womanness instead of the artistic
qualities and intricacies of her prints. In this thesis I offer a
different kind of scholarly engagement with Kollwitz and her works,
closely examining a set of her images and discussing their
significance in terms of contextually relevant theatrical and
cultural sources and theories. While recognizing the importance of
Kollwitz's identity as a woman artist, I hope to convey in this
project that the visual content of her prints and their direct
influences constitute sufficient material for analysis without
needing to invariably situate them within, or connect them to,
details of her biography.
Kollwitz based her Weavers' Rebellion cycle on a
play by Gerhart Hauptmann (1862-1946) called The Weavers
(Die Weber, 1893), which dramatizes the Silesian weavers'
rebellion of the 1840s. I use scholarly discussions of Hauptmann's
work by the playwright Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) and the literary
critic Peter Szondi (1929-1971) to analyze the ways in which
Kollwitz's cycle represents these workers. An initial consideration
of both Hauptmann's The Weavers and Kollwitz's A Weavers'
Rebellion suggests dominant readings of the works as tragic and
Naturalist, evoking feelings of empathy and pity that purge
audiences of reactive feelings and do nothing to liberate the
workers from their conditions. Further examination of both play and
cycle, however, exposes epic aspects that explicitly engage
contemporary contexts and reveal social structures responsible for
the workers' oppression. This interdisciplinary project relies on
critical theory, philosophy, and art historical methods to provide
a long warranted, in-depth analysis of Kollwitz's
images.","Introduction............... 1 -- Chapter One: Drama and Epic in

approved,emory:pj6rf,"Branch, Mary Rose",Shedding light on the spatiotemporal regulation of RGS14,"RGS14 is a multifunctional scaffold protein that
integrates various cellular pathways and interacts with active
(GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) Gα
subunits to negatively regulate G protein signaling. RGS14 is
enriched in area CA2 of the hippocampus where it acts as a natural
suppressor of long-term potentiation. The functional role of RGS14
in CA2 neurons and the mechanisms by which it limits synaptic
plasticity, however, are unknown. The subcellular localization of
proteins in their native cellular environment can provide critical
insight into their in vivo functions. All previous
information about the subcellular localization of RGS14 relied
largely on exogenous expression of recombinant protein in non-host
cells. Since mislocalization of exogenously expressed proteins is a
common problem that can give a false impression of the endogenous
protein's distribution and in vivo
functionalities, the primary aim of this study was to
investigate the subcellular localization of endogenous RGS14 in its
native cellular environment under basal conditions and following G
protein activation. Because CA2 neurons cannot be
isolated for study, we studied RGS14 localization in B35
neuroblastoma cells, the only cell line known to natively express
RGS14. Using immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging, we
found that endogenous RGS14 localizes to multiple cellular
compartments in host B35 cells and that both inactive and activated
G proteins can regulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of RGS14. Our
results suggest that RGS14 may have multiple and complex functions
in CA2 neurons, highlighting the need for future studies to
determine which of these functions is critical for RGS14-mediated
suppression of synaptic plasticity.","Table of Contents -- Background and Significance..1 --

Spontaneous Preterm Birth","African Americans are at increased risk for spontaneous preterm
birth (PTB), but the biological mechanisms underlying PTB are not
yet known. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, may provide
insight into the genes that are being actively regulated in those
that deliver or are delivered preterm. The objective of this study
was to evaluate DNA methylation in paired maternal blood and
umbilical cord blood (fetal) samples to identify patterns specific
to PTB. Peripheral blood from African American women who delivered
preterm (24-34 weeks) or at term (39-41weeks) was assessed for DNA
methylation across the genome using the HumanMethylation450
BeadChip. In maternal samples, no sites associated after correction
for multiple comparisons though 17,829 CpG sites associated with
PTB (p&lt;.05). Examination of paired samples, irrespective of PTB
status, identified 5,171 CpG sites in which methylation of maternal
samples predicted methylation of her respective neonate (false
discovery rate (FDR)&lt;.05). The majority of correlated CpG sites
could be attributed to one or more nearby genetic variants.
However, correlated CpG sites were significantly more likely to be
in genes involved in metabolic, cardiovascular and immune pathways,
suggesting a role for genetic and environmental contributions to
PTB risk. The observation that maternal epigenetic differences
predict fetal methylation may provide insight into the heritability
of PTB. In umbilical cord blood samples, we identified ~10,000 CpG
sites that associate with gestational age (GA), only 29 of which
associated with PTB when controlling for GA, suggesting that the
majority of CpG sites primarily reflect developmental differences
between preterm and term samples. In order to assess the
association of DNA methylation with childhood outcomes, we
investigated DNA methylation of calcitonin (CALCA), which
associated with GA in cord blood and PTB in maternal blood. DNA
methylation of CALCA did not associate with or mediate the
relationship between maternal depressive symptoms, a known risk
factor for PTB and internalizing behavioral in childhood. These
finding show the importance of DNA methylation in understanding the
risk and consequences of PTB in African Americans.","Chapter 1: Preterm Birth and Its Long-Term Effects: Methylation to

GFR were studied using principal component scores in multiple
linear regression analyses. Statistically significant associations
between GFR and circulating EPCs were observed in both unadjusted
and adjusted analyses, indicating improvement in the number of EPCs
especially those with certain VEGF cell types contribute to an
increase in GFR levels.
Conclusions: Age, race, hypertension and diabetes are
significant risk factors for CKD. EPCs are shown to be
significantly associated with the GFR levels in the patients with
CKD after adjusting for conventional risk factors. EPCs might be
considered to be a potential therapeutic target for CKD, although
more investigations still need to be implemented.","-- 1.

submitted,emory:f4vtm,"Kitami, Momoko","The Association between Advanced Maternal Age and Adverse
Hypertensive and Diabetic Complications During Pregnancy: A
Six-year Retrospective Cohort Study in Metro Atlanta, USA","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of advanced
maternal age on adverse hypertensive and diabetic complications of
pregnancy, in relation to other major risk factors.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using Kaiser
Permanente Georgia electronic health data of pregnant women
receiving prenatal care in 12 Kaiser-affiliated Obstetrics and
Gynaecology facilities between January 1, 2005 and August 31, 2011,
with linked Georgia Birth Certificate data. Women were divided into
two age groups: 1) reference group who were 35-39 years old, and 2)
advanced maternal age (AMA) group who were 40 years and older.
Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) were calculated after adjusting for
correlation among women with multiple pregnancies, and relevant
confounders (maternal race, obesity, infertility, gravidity,
maternal education, marital status, and pre-existing medical
conditions) using log-Binomial or log-Poisson regression
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1181 pregnancies of 1096 women (939
women in reference group, 157 in AMA group) were included in the
study. Risk of chronic hypertension was significantly higher in the
AMA group (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 2.05; 95%CI, 1.48-2.86), but
risk of transient hypertension (aRR, 1.07; 95%CI, 0.51-2.22), mild
preeclampsia (aRR 1.31; 95%CI, 0.61-2.81), severe
preeclampsia/eclampsia (aRR 0.87; 95%CI, 0.26-2.86), chronic
diabetes (aRR 0.74; 95%CI, 0.37-1.50), and gestational diabetes
(aRR 0.97; 95%CI, 0.59-1.59) were not significantly increased in
the AMA group. When risk of having any hypertensive complications
was evaluated separately for white and black maternal race, AMA
remained a significant risk factor among blacks (p=0.002), but note
whites (p=0.15). Although risk of having preeclampsia or eclampsia
was more fully explained by history of chronic hypertension and
marital status than AMA, no significant risk factor was identified
for transient hypertension. Obesity, primigravida, and Asian
maternal race were identified as more significant risk factors for
gestational diabetes compared to AMA.
CONCLUSION: Advanced maternal age is an important risk
factor for chronic hypertension, but other risk factors such as
obesity, maternal race, gravidity, and pre-existing medical
conditions may play a larger role in the development of
preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Strength of
association of these risk factors may vary depending on maternal
race.","Chapter 1. Literature

submitted,emory:ph137,"Goulding, Sandra Moore",Social Cognitive Performance and the Psychosis-Spectrum Prodrome,"Social cognitive (SC) impairment is pervasive in chronic and
first-episode psychosis (FEP) samples, and an emerging body of
research suggests individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for
psychosis exhibit deficits intermediate to those found in healthy
control (HC) and FEP groups. However, given the limited body of
literature to date, it is unclear how SC deficits are linked with
illness progression. This current investigation examines multiple
SC domains (i.e., emotional processing/recognition, theory of mind,
and relationship/social perception) in a sample large enough to
compare SC performance between HC and CHR groups, examine the
influence of sex on SC performance in the CHR group, and determine
the relatedness of SC performance to clinical symptoms and
functional status in CHR subjects at both baseline and 12-month
follow-up. Results indicated SC deficits in the CHR group relative
to the HC group. The influence of sex on SC performance was mixed
depending on the SC domain measured. Similarly, at baseline,
support for the relatedness of SC deficits and clinical
symptoms/functioning varied as a function of the measure. Finally,
there was no support for the predictive utility of baseline SC
deficits for clinical symptoms and functioning at 12-month
follow-up. Overall, this study contributes to efforts purposed to
gain a more thorough understanding of the role of SC impairment in
the psychosis-spectrum of disorders. Although prior investigations
suggest the predictive utility of SC for detecting those at CHR for
psychosis conversion, results from this study indicate that SC is
likely best understood as a clinical outcome domain that prompts
help-seeking behaviors in individuals who present at CHR
clinics.","--  --  --

submitted,emory:pq2tn,"Liu, Shuling","Joint Modeling Approaches for Clustered Survival Data with Random
Cluster Size","The first part of this dissertation focuses on the development
of copula based joint modeling approaches for the clustered
survival data with a random cluster size. We propose to adopt
Clayton-Oakes model (Clayton, 1978; Oakes, 1989) for measurements
within a cluster and the cluster size is modeled via a discrete
survival model. The methods are motivated by the Mount Sinai Study
of Women Office Workers (MSSWOW) where women were prospectively
followed for one year for studying fertility. For each woman,
menstrual cycle lengths (MCLs) are recorded until time-to-pregnancy
(TTP) or the end of study.
We first consider specifying a parametric distribution as the
marginal survival distribution in the Clayton-Oakes model and TTP
is modeled using a grouped version of the usual continuous time Cox
regression model (Scheike and Jensen, 1997). Second, we consider a
semiparametric linear transformation model (Cheng et al., 1995) for
the marginal distribution of the Clayton-Oakes model. We develop an
EM algorithm to derive an approximate generalized maximum
likelihood estimator. We also provide a computationally simple
estimation procedure known as the ""two-stage"" approach. Asymptotic
theory for the ""two-stage"" estimators is established. Simulation
studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
joint model and estimation procedures. The proposed methods are
also applied to the MSSWOW data.
In the second part of this dissertation, we consider the
problem of testing whether a repeatedly measured quantitative
biomarker is associated with a subsequent time-to-event process. We
propose a nonparametric testing procedure to evaluate the null
hypothesis by adopting a linear mixed model for repeated measures,
but without imposing modeling assumptions on the time to event. The
proposed test can utilize all the information provided by the
random effects and is not sensitive to the model misspecification
of the time-to-event process. We show that the proposed test
statistic is asymptotically consistent and normally distributed
under both null and alternative hypotheses. We demonstrate the
validity of the new nonparametric test using simulation studies and
compare the proposed method to a model-based score test. We finally
apply the proposed method to a real data from epidemiological study
to illustrate its practical utility.","Contents -- Abstract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

submitted,emory:pqnbg,"Hankins, Timothy","To Suffer and to Overcome: The Ecclesiology of James Cone and Karl
Barth","James Cone and Karl Barth have very different, but ultimately
compatible and even complementary views of the nature and mission
of the Church. A survey of the two theologians' work reveals an
emphasis in Cone's writing on the Church as a community
characterized by and participating in the suffering of Christ, and
an emphasis in Barth's writing on the Church as a community
characterized by and participating in the victory of Christ. It
would seem that these two points of view are conflicting. However,
since both theologians take as a point of departure the historical
and theological reality of the incarnation of the Word of God,
there is an intersection between their views of the Church. In the
incarnation of Jesus Christ, we see the convergence of suffering
and triumph, both the reality of death and the promise of
resurrection. Jesus Christ, in the incarnation, is God's statement
of solidarity with those who suffer, those who are oppressed. The
Kingdom of God is ultimately a kingdom of the oppressed. God with
and for God's people is the God who has shown willingness to suffer
alongside those who suffer. The Church, which is the ongoing
incarnation of Jesus Christ in the world, must suffer in order to
experience the restoration of all things to their right
relationship with God. The Church achieves the nexus of its praxis
and its kerygma when it proclaims that, while suffering is
not the last word in the life of the Church, its suffering is
necessary in order to experience ultimate triumph over the kingdom
of this world. The Church participates in Christ's final victory
because the Church shares in Christ's suffering. There is no
resurrection if there is no cross. Here the ecclesiological
viewpoints of Barth and Cone come into conversation and find common
ground with one another. This essay will examine Barth and Cone in
their particular contexts as theologians, as teachers, and as
pastors in order to articulate similarities and differences in
their ecclesiological perspectives and to discern how these
perspectives might apply to the Church today.","Introduction...................................................................................................................................

submitted,emory:pqjdf,"Lu, Xin","Estimation of Potential Outcomes when Treatment Assignment and
Discontinuation Compete in Observational Data","In clinical studies, randomization of treatment lengths may not
be feasible in practice, resulting in the confounding of treatment
effects. Moreover, treatment decisions may be missing due to
treatment-terminating events. Therefore, to estimate the mean
outcome across treatment lengths while accounting for the above
obstacles, we propose several new estimators using causal inference
theory and methods for different treatment assignment
settings.

In the first project, we propose a new direct estimator for the
mean outcome of a target treatment length policy using outcome
regression. The estimator works well in both discrete and
continuous time. We exemplify the direct estimator through small
sample numerical studies and the analysis of two real data sets and
show the direct estimator is more precise.

In many dynamic regimes, patients' treatment plan may vary with
changes in their clinical characteristics that measured at routine
clinic visits, which may also be confounded with patients'
outcomes. To taking into account of the time-varying effects, in
the second project, we implemented the G-computational algorithm in
outcome regression with two approaches to estimate the mean
potential outcome on treatment length policies. In simulation
studies, our approaches are more efficient compared to an existing
inverse probability weighting estimator. It could also approximate
the distribution as well as the mean of the potential
outcomes.

To maintain the consistency of our estimators proposed in the
previous two projects, the outcome regression models must be
correctly specified, which may not be always met. To achieve a
consistent estimation under moderate miss-specification, under the
same dynamic regime setting as project 2, we propose a
doubly-robust estimator and an improved doubly-robust estimators
for estimating the mean potential outcomes while adjusting for
time-varying effects. They demonstrate desirable properties for
small samples in simulation studies and the improved doubly robust
estimator achieves minimum variance even when the outcome
regression model may be miss-specified.","--  -- Contents -- 1 Introduction 1 -- 1.1 Introduction .

The
association between urinary phytoestrogen levels and
prostate-specific antigen levels in men aged 40 and over in the US
population
by
Philip Aka Jr.
Primary Objective: To determine if
there is an association or correlation between phytoestrogenic
levels in men aged 40 and older and their PSA levels.
Secondary Objective: To confirm the
findings of previous studies that suggest a positive association
between phytoestrogens and PSA levels in men.
Research Design and Methods: The
sample analyzed is available in the 2009-2010 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset and includes 676 male
subjects age 40 and over after excluding those with missing data
for phytoestrogens. Serum PSA concentration was considered the
dependent and urinary phytoestrogen levels were consider
independent variables. Six phytoestrogens were analyzed. These
included daidzein, equol, genistein, enterodiol, enterolactone, and
O-Desmethylangolensin (O-DMA). Possible confounders included
race/ethnicity, smoking status, age, educational level,
poverty-income ratio (PIR), HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol, and
triglycerides. These variables were confounders because each has
been correlated and/or associated with increased prostate cancer
risk and can possibly be associated with phytoestrogen
levels.
Results: No statistically significant
associations between phytoestrogen levels and PSA were
found.
Conclusions: In a small sample of the
US adult male population aged 40 and over, it appears that
phytoestrogenic levels have no association with PSA
levels.","TABLE OF CONTENTS --

reviewed,emory:pq3x5,"Murphy, Lauren",Social and Emotional Development in Pre-Adolescent Macaques,"Aberrant social and emotional function is a hallmark of many of
neuropsychological disorders emerging during adolescence, such as
depression and anxiety. To advance a mechanistic understanding of
social development during this period, a primate model of
adolescence is needed and will provide a vehicle for the
application of novel therapies. I propose the rhesus macaque as a
model due to the species social complexity and protracted childhood
and adolescent period.
To measure social maturation in untrained, nonverbal animals I
measured behavioral changes to social and emotional stimuli using
infrared eye tracking and an emotional
reactivity task in three juvenile and three adult male macaques.
Juveniles were tested at 18, 22, and 26 months of age, making this
the first longitudinal examination of macaque adolescent social
development.
As measured by changes in fixation duration and frequency to the
eyes and body of unknown macaques, I report normative adult
patterns, as well as developmental changes, in nonhuman social and
emotional processing. In adults, the eyes negative social stimuli
are looked at more frequently than neutral or positive stimuli.
However, this normative pattern is not seen in the late juvenile
stage. At 18 months of age, macaques look longer at social stimuli
generally, and usually without regard to emotion. By 22 months,
this broad social attention significantly decreases within both the
body and the eyes. At 26 months, fixation duration once again
increases, and is now accompanied by more adult-like patterns of
emotional attention. In addition to changes in fixation behavior,
measures of emotional reactivity correspond with this pattern, such
that 18 month olds are reactive to novel stimuli irrespective of
valence, but by 22 and 26 months of age they show an adult-like
pattern of increased reactivity only toward novel negative stimuli.
Taken together, these data document continuing pre-pubertal changes
in social and emotional attention toward an adult-like pattern in a
nonhuman primate. These data lay the groundwork for future
comparative studies with human subjects that may elucidate the
ongoing development of social and emotional processing during the
adolescent period.","INTRODUCTION................................................................................................................

reviewed,emory:pfrv9,"Dong, Lu","The Role of Perinatal Depression in the Development of Co-occurring
Aggression and Anxiety/Depression Problems","Maternal depression is a well-established risk factor for
a range of negative developmental outcomes in offspring, including
internalizing and externalizing problems. However, the role of
maternal depression in the development of co-occurring
internalizing and externalizing problems is not well understood.
Given the chronicity and severity of co-occurring child behavior
problems, it is important to understand the contributing risk
factors and mechanisms for these outcomes. Using a group-based
trajectory modeling technique, the current study identified
developmental trajectory groups that exhibited chronic co-occurring
aggression and anxiety/depression problems, only chronic aggression
problems, and only chronic anxiety/depression problems. Exposure to
perinatal maternal depression (both prenatal and postnatal) was
examined in relation to these distinct behavioral problem groups.
Mediation and moderation paths were also tested to understand the
mechanisms through which maternal depression may have its impact
and to identify subgroups that might be at higher risk. Results
revealed differential patterns in the risk and mechanisms of risk
transmission from prenatal/postnatal depression to chronic
co-occurring, chronic aggression, and chronic anxiety/depression
problems. In particular, our results revealed direct associations
between prenatal and postnatal maternal depression and co-occurring
problems, and prenatal maternal depression and chronic aggression.
In addition, we found support for the mediating roles of stressful
family environments and negative maternal parenting. Implications
of these findings on psychopathology research and
prevention/intervention strategies were discussed.","Table of Contents --

reviewed,emory:pq49s,"Wiinikka-Lydon, Joe","Violence and the Language of Virtue: Political Violence, Ethical
Discourse, and Moral Transformation","Some who survive mass violence feel they have done so only by
committing acts previously thought to be immoral. This can leave a
lasting change in one's moral subjectivity, so much so that
survivors often wonder if they can ever be ""good"" again. This is an
issue for many who pass through violence feeling that they are no
longer able to live in society, or even that society or the world
can no longer be seen as a place where goodness is possible,
however goodness is defined. Political violence can undermine the
moral intelligibility of one's world, leaving a residue of doubt
and even despair about the possibility of a restored moral ability
and a world capable of supporting a meaningful moral life.

This work focuses on ways that we can better understand experiences
where political violence and upheaval transform the self as well as
society. New vocabularies are needed to articulate what matters
most for those caught in contemporary violent conflicts, as current
frames do not capture the high moral stakes involved for
individuals. Specifically, we need to draw on the moral languages
and philosophical anthropologies found in religious ethics and
moral philosophy if we are to do justice to these experiences and
the high stakes that are involved. I argue that the language of the
virtues, in particular, can help us create a thick representation
of the self not just as a subject in the world but primarily as a
moral subject for whom experience is best understood as moral
development through continuous transformation of one's moral
subjectivity. Such a resource is not currently available in most
discussions of political violence. Virtue discourse, as I will
refer to it, will provide the vocabulary and understanding of the
self needed to account for and articulate the experience of
political violence. Using Iris Murdoch's moral philosophy, and
specifically her representation of moral subjectivity as a ""field
of tension"" and a search for the ""Good,"" I create a critical,
interpretive framework to better articulate and account for the
felt sense of having lost moral ability through the experience of
political violence.","Chapter One: Violence, Self, and Virtue 1 -- Violence and

reviewed,emory:pmtrf,"Hampton, Joya","Effects of atypical antipsychotic use and stress on weight in
individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis","Extant literature suggests that individuals with serious mental
illness are at increased risk for overweight and obesity (Robson
&amp; Gray, 2007), and the introduction of pharmacological
interventions, particularly atypical antipsychotics, puts this
population at greater risk for increased adiposity and metabolic
issues (Green et al., 2000). Research also indicates that those who
suffer from severe mental illness experience greater stress
(Trotman et al., 2014). Given that stress is also related to
overweight and obesity (Adam &amp; Epel, 2007), exploration of the
relationship between atypical antipsychotic medication, stress, and
weight is warranted. This study was a cross-sectional investigation
of atypical antipsychotic use and stress in predicting weight in a
sample of youth at clinical high risk for developing psychosis.
Participant data was obtained as a part of the North American
Prodrome Longitudinal Study Phase 2 (NAPLS-2). Self-reported
weight, atypical antipsychotic use, daily stress (hassles) in the
past 24 hours, and life events stress within the last year were
assessed in clinical high-risk participants who were on and off
atypical antipsychotics at an initial assessment as a part of the
longitudinal study. Individuals taking atypical antipsychotic
medications weighed more than those not taking these medications,
and several measures of stressful events (dependent life events,
desirable life events, and undesirable life events stress) were
correlated with weight. Gender did not moderate the effect of
atypical antipsychotic use on weight but dependent events and
desirable life events stress moderated the relationship between
atypical antipsychotic use and weight. Post hoc analyses revealed
that there was a significant relationship between atypical
antipsychotic use and negative and general symptoms. Findings
suggest that a better understanding of the contribution of stress
to weight gain in this population may be worthwhile to consider in
developing interventions to address psychosocial factors that may
exacerbate or buffer the effects of antipsychotic medication on
weight gain.","-- TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction 1-5 -- Atypical Antipsychotic

reviewed,emory:pq8t8,"Schechter, Julia Corwin","Maternal Prenatal Distress and Child Cognitive Outcomes During the
Preschool Years","Background: A great deal of animal research as well as available
human research suggests that psychological distress experienced by
the mother during gestation is associated with later
neurodevelopmental deficits in offspring. However, most research
investigating the outcomes associated with prenatal stress in
humans has been conducted during infancy, leaving many questions
unanswered regarding the long term effects of prenatal distress on
child neurocognitive development. The current study examined the
impact of maternal distress during pregnancy on neurocognitive
outcomes in preschool age children, as well as potential mediators
and moderators of this risk pathway. Specifically, children's
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning (i.e., cortisol
reactivity) was examined as a mediator and parenting behaviors were
examined as moderators. Methods: Mother-child dyads (N=162)
were recruited from a longitudinal cohort of women who had
previously participated in a study on maternal mood during
pregnancy. Maternal distress during pregnancy was constructed as a
latent variable, based on a combination of self-report and
clinician rated measures collected throughout the course of
pregnancy. During a follow-up visit, information was collected
regarding mother's symptomatology since the child's birth and
children's neurocognitive abilities. In addition, cortisol
reactivity was assessed via saliva samples before and after a
stressor task, and parenting behaviors were recorded during a
parent-child interaction. Results: Maternal prenatal distress
significantly predicted to children's lower general cognitive and
expressive language abilities. This relationship was moderated by
parent positive engagement such that the relationship was strongest
for children whose mothers exhibited low levels of positive
engagement and was not significant for mothers who exhibited high
levels of positive engagement. Children's cortisol reactivity was
not found to be a mediator. Conclusions: Prenatal maternal
distress, measured in a multi-informant, comprehensive manner
predicts to lower cognitive functioning in preschool aged children,
particularly when mothers display low levels of positive parenting.
The findings are discussed with regard to clinical implications and
future research directions.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- Introduction

reviewed,emory:pmpr1,"LoParo, Devon","Direct and Indirect Relations Between Reactive and Proactive
Aggression, Facial Emotion Recognition, and Polymorphisms in the
Monoamine Oxidase A and Serotonin Transporter Genes","Research has demonstrated that individuals high in antisocial
traits tend to have difficulty recognizing fearful and sad facial
expressions, though researchers have not attempted to link these
deficits to specific forms of aggression, such as reactive and
proactive aggression. Two genetic markers frequently studied in
association with aggression, a repeat sequence in the promoter
region of the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA-uVNTR) and a
polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter
gene (5-HTTLPR). These genes are active in brain regions involved
in aggression and facial emotion recognition, such as the amygdala
and regulatory prefrontal regions, suggesting that facial emotion
recognition deficits or biases may serve as endophenotypes for
aggression. In a sample of 180 twins genotyped for the MAOA-uVNTR
and 5-HTTLPR, we found that the MAOA-uVNTR low-activity allele was
associated with a lower proportion of correct fear recognitions,
more fear commission errors, and more sad commission errors on a
facial emotion recognition task, while the 5-HTTLPR short allele
was associated with a higher proportion of correct sad recognitions
and more sad commissions. We also found that fewer correct fear
recognitions, more fear commissions, and the MAOA-uVNTR risk allele
were associated with reactive aggression, while more fear
commissions was also associated with proactive aggression. In
addition, we found that the proportion of correct fear
recognitions, and fear and sad commissions separately mediated the
relation between the MAOA-uVNTR and reactive aggression. These
results suggest that impaired fear recognition is related to both
reactive and proactive aggression. Further, the influence of
MAOA-uVNTR on reactive aggression seems to act in part through
impaired fear recognition, indicating that facial emotion
recognition may be a useful endophenotype for reactive
aggression.","Table of Contents -- General Introduction 1 -- Current Study 9 --

reviewed,emory:pmh0g,"Zhao, Jingran","Corporate Information Environment Dynamics and Equity Valuation An
Analysis of Mandatory disclosures, Voluntary disclosures, and
Information Intermediaries","This paper examines the dynamics of a firm's information
environment and how the components of the firm's information
environment affect equity valuation of the firm. I examine the
dynamics of a firm's information environment by investigating the
relations among mandatory disclosures
(ManDisc), voluntary disclosures
(VolDisc), and information generated by
information intermediaries (InfoInt). I find
that firms with superior ManDisc also have
superior VolDisc and superior
InfoInt. The positive correlations between the three
information channels suggest they are complementary in
communicating to investors. I then examine the impact of the three
information channels on equity valuation. Specifically, I examine
the impact of each information channel on the stock price deviation
from the firm's fundamental value, as calculated by the residual
income valuation model. In the unconditional tests, I find that all
three information channels affect equity valuation. However, in the
conditional tests, I find that the disclosure effect of
ManDisc on equity valuation disappears when I control
for VolDisc and InfoInt.
This evidence cautions against drawing inferences exclusively from
the evidence of relations between equity valuation and one
information channel. All three information channels contribute to a
firm's overall information environment.","TABLE OF CONTENTS -- CONTENT PAGE -- 1. Introduction
