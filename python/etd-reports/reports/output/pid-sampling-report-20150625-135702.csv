Outbreak of Cryptosporidiosis in Kansas, 2003","Multivariate Analysis of Risk Factors Associated with a
Community Outbreak of
Cryptosporidiosis in Kansas, 2003
By Lina Brou
Background: The chlorine-resistant protozoan,
Cryptosporidium, commonly associated with
daycare and swimming facilities, has emerged as the leading known
cause of recreational waterborne
diarrhea outbreaks in the United States. In the summer of 2003, an
outbreak of cryptosporidiosis
occurred among residents of one county in Kansas.
Methods: To determine the magnitude of the outbreak and
identify risk factors for infection, we
performed a secondary analysis of a county-wide matched
case-control interview study. Subjects
included laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis cases (n=63), a
random sample of clinical cases
(n=88), and age-matched controls identified by random-digit dialing
(n=302). Clinical
cryptosporidiosis was defined as diarrhea (≥3 loose stools in
a 24 hour period) for ≥ 3 days within a
one week period after June 15, 2003. Conditional logistic
regression was the primary statistical
methodology used.
Results: The final model included the following predictors:
treated recreational water (adjusted
matched odds ratio = 7.753; 95% CI = 3.577, 16.804; p-value
&lt;0.0001), having a child in childcare
outside of the home (amOR = 3.609; 95% CI = 1.69, 7.709; p-value =
0.0009), and having a
household contact with diarrhea (amOR = 10.575; 95% CI = 5.102,
21.916; p-value&lt;0.0001). To
identify which facilities could be implicated, a second model
resulted in the following predictors:
Swimming Pool D (amOR = 4.324; 95% CI = 1.087, 17.209; p-value =
0.0377); Daycare 2 wading
pool (amOR = 19.475; 95% CI = 2.719, 139.464; p-value = 0.0031);
and having a household contact
with diarrhea (amOR = 7.914; 95%CI = 2.744, 22.821; p-value =
0.0001). No interaction terms were
significant and there was no indication of collinearity.
Discussion: This is one of the largest reported U.S.
community-wide cryptosporidiosis outbreaks
and the first outbreak associated with this Cryptosporidium
subtype. Although the original source of
the outbreak was identified as a single contaminated swimming pool,
the outbreak spread throughout
the community via secondary and tertiary exposures (i.e., daycare
exposure and person-to-person
contact). It draws attention to the need for collaborative efforts
between local, state, and federal
agencies to define and develop policies that facilitate prompt
intervention to prevent community-
wide transmission of Cryptosporidium.","Table of Contents -- 1. Background 1 -- 1.1 Epidemiology 3 -- 1.2

and Neurochemical Effects of Cocaine in the Squirrel Monkey","Abstract
Despite substantial efforts, there are currently no
pharmacotherapeutics available for the
treatment of cocaine abuse. Accumulating evidence indicates that
indirect serotonin receptor agonists attenuate the behavioral and
neurochemical effects of cocaine in animals and, accordingly,
attenuate the subjective effects of cocaine in humans, but the
specific receptor subtypes mediating these effects remain unknown.
Recent studies have demonstrated that compounds exhibiting
selectivity for both the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and
5-HT2C
receptor (5-HT2CR) differentially modulate the behavioral and
neurochemical effects of cocaine
in rodents, but such compounds have yet to be systematically
evaluated in nonhuman primates.
The goals of the present experiments were therefore to determine
the impact of pretreatment
with the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist M100907, the preferential and
selective 5-HT2CR agonists
mCPP and Ro 60-0175, and the selective 5-HT2CR antagonist SB
242084, upon the behavioral-
stimulant, reinforcing, reinstatement, and neurochemical effects of
cocaine in squirrel monkeys.
The results indicated that 5-HT2CR agonism attenuated, whereas
5-HT2CR antagonism enhanced,
the behavioral-stimulant and reinstatement effects of cocaine in a
dose-dependent manner.
Pretreatment with Ro 60-0175 also dose-dependently attenuated the
direct reinforcing effects
of cocaine. In contrast, administration of SB 242084 alone produced
modest behavioral-
stimulant effects and this compound also exhibited reinforcing
effectiveness when substituted
for cocaine availability in a self-administration procedure. The
impact of pretreatment with Ro
60-0175 and SB 242084 upon the behavioral effects of cocaine were
correlated with a selective
reduction or enhancement, respectively, of cocaine-induced dopamine
increases within the
mesolimbic dopamine system. Finally, pretreatment with M100907 did
not alter any behavioral
effects of cocaine. These results suggest that 5-HT2CR agonists may
represent a novel class of
pharmacotherapeutics for the treatment of cocaine abuse as they
functionally antagonized the
behavioral and neurochemical effects of cocaine in nonhuman
primates. Furthermore, the
selective 5-HT2CR antagonist SB 242084 exhibited a behavioral
profile similar to other
psychostimulants and may warrant consideration as a candidate
substitute agonist therapy for
the treatment of cocaine abuse, although the demonstration of its
reinforcing effectiveness may
be an indication of abuse liability.","Table of Contents -- I.

Stranded in Arabic:
Tales of the Novel in Translation
By Maya Kesrouany
This dissertation examines the history of the translation of the
European novel into
Arabic from the middle of the 19th century until the 1930's
primarily in Egypt and
Lebanon. It studies the complex exchange in this particular context
of translation
under different forms of British and French colonization and under
Ottoman rule,
reading four such performances of translation into Arabic closely:
Buṭrus al-Bustānī's
1861 translation of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719),
Muṣṭafa al-Manfalūṭī's
1923 translation of Bernadin de Saint-Pierre's Paul et
Virginie (1788) and his 1915
adaptation of François René de Chateaubriand's
René and Atala (1802), Muḥammad
al-Sibā‗ī's 1912 translation of Charles Dickens's
A Tale of Two Cities (1859), and
finally Muḥammad Ḥusayn Haykal's 2-volume biography of
Jean Jacques Rousseau,
published in 1921 and 1923. The dissertation argues that the novel
in Arabic cannot
be read except through the complex exchange that happens in the
translation of the
European text into the Arabic context. Re-reading canonical
mappings of the
development of the novel, my dissertation also seeks to use the
context of translation
into Arabic to uncover some of the assumptions of Western
genealogical accounts of
the novel. Moreover, in exposing these assumptions, ―Stranded
in Arabic‖ works to
unveil some of the intricacies of the translation process and to
show how such
particular moments of adaptation into a foreign language can help
us rethink the
concept of genre and reception much more broadly, across and in
spite of national
boundaries. The Introduction lays out a general historical map of
the movement of
translation and then takes up particular theories that speak to the
complexity of the
translation of the novel into an Arabic context. The following
chapters place each
translator in a particular socio-historical setting and then read
his translations closely
in comparison with the British and French originals. Every chapter
concludes on the
particular borrowings and form of each translation and the insight
those provide into
the originals and into the novel as a genre.","Contents -- Introduction: Hybrid Souls: The Translator's Debt 1 --

THE IMPACT OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS ON OVARIAN CANCER
SURVIVAL AMONG GEORGIA WOMEN DIAGNOSED FROM 2001-2005
By Lisa Melissa Matz
Objectives: The goal of this study was to examine
the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on ovarian cancer survival
among women in Georgia who were diagnosed with malignant ovarian
cancer from 2001-2005 with follow-up until 2008. Low SES has been
previously shown to negatively impact health outcomes, though the
impact on ovarian cancer survival is relatively unknown. Knowing
the impact of SES will help to more fully understand disparities in
ovarian cancer survival.
Methods: Using data from the Georgia Cancer
Registry, all cases of malignant ovarian cancer among women in
Georgia were identified. Based on the recommendations of the Public
Health Disparities Geocoding Project, percentage of persons living
in poverty by census tract was used an area-based measure of SES.
Three-year cause-specific survival adjusted for age, race, marital
status, stage, histology, grade, and treatment was estimated using
Cox proportional hazards modeling. Three-year relative survival
ratios were estimated using age and year-specific U.S life tables.
Cause-specific and relative survival were estimated for cases with
a single primary ovarian cancer and subsequently for all cases
regardless of other cancer diagnoses.
Results: Women living in areas with the highest
poverty had significantly lower 3-year cause-specific survival than
women living in areas with little to no poverty. After controlling
for covariates, the hazard ratio for women living in the highest
poverty category was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.18, 1.76). Including cases
with prior or subsequent cancer diagnoses also resulted in a
significant association (HR (95% CI) = 1.48 (1.23, 1.78)). Compared
to women living in areas with little to no poverty, three-year
relative survival was lowest for women living in the highest
poverty category (38% vs. 64%). This relationship held when higher
order cancers were included in the analysis (39% vs.
65%).
Conclusions: This study identified SES as a
significant factor in ovarian cancer survival among women living in
Georgia. Women living in poverty are at greater risk of dying from
ovarian cancer compared to women living low poverty. Future
research should focus on decomposing this relationship to determine
precisely how low SES negatively impacts ovarian cancer
survival.","Table of Contents --
