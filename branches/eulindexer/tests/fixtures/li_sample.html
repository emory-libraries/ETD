<A name=4></a>Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) was engineered to an aldehyde-oxidizing enzyme <br>
(ADH) by a single amino acid mutation with the benefit of identifying the functional <br>
roles of active site amino acids in the related XDH and aldehyde oxidase (AO) enzymes <br>
that distinguish their respective catalytic activities. Arg355Met<i> C. acidovorans</i> XDH was <br>
expressed and purified using pUCP-Nde/<i>P. aeruginosa</i> expression system. Arg355Met <br>
XDH exhibits a similar UV-Vis spectrum and CD spectrum with those of the wild-type <br>
XDH. On comparison with wild-type enzyme, the mutant enzyme shows 0.4% of the <i>kcat </i><br>
with xanthine, and 3% with hypoxanthine. Interestingly, Arg355Met XDH shows <br>
catalytic activity with phenanthridine, which is a substrate of AO but not a substrate of <br>
XDH. These results suggest that the Arg355Met XDH has a similar active site structure <br>
to that of the wild-type XDH and that Arg355 plays an important role in catalysis of <br>
xanthine hydroxylation. The Arg355Met mutation results in the functional conversion of <br>
XDH to that of an aldehyde dehydrogenase.  <br>
Glu758Gln XDH mutant expressed from <i>P. aeruginosa</i> was purified. An imidazole <br>
gradient was used for elution from Ni-NTA column during purification to separate the <br>
endogenous XDH in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> from the expressed mutant enzyme, because the <br>
presence of endogenous XDH will interfere with the kinetic behavior of the expressed <br>
enzyme that exhibits a very low catalytic activity. The recombinant mutant enzyme <br>
exhibits UV-Vis and CD spectral properties very similar to the wild-type XDH, and <br>
kinetic characterization of the Glu758Gln XDH at pH 7.8 reveals only 0.002% of <br>
turnover number of the wild-type XDH. The result shows the importance of Glu758 in <br>
 <br>
<hr>
<A name=5></a>the catalytic mechanism of xanthine hydroxylation. Combined with previous results from <br>
our lab, a catalytic mechanism was proposed with Glu758 as a general base to initiate the <br>
reaction by deprotonating the Mo-OH group.  <br>
