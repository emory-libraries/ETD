Abstract <br>
 <br>
Ambient Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Malformations in Atlanta, Georgia <br>
 <br>
 <br>
In this dissertation I investigated temporal relationships between ambient air pollution levels <br>
during weeks three through seven of pregnancy and risk of cardiovascular malformations among <br>
the cohort of infants and fetuses conceived during January 1, 1986 through March 12, 2003 in <br>
Atlanta, Georgia. Records of infants and fetuses with cardiovascular malformations were <br>
obtained from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, which conducts active, <br>
population-based birth defects surveillance on this cohort. These surveillance records were <br>
reviewed to exclude infants with transient newborn conditions and to group infants and fetuses <br>
with similar cardiovascular malformations for analysis. Ambient air pollution measurements of 8-<br>
hour maximum ozone and 24-hour average carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter <br>
&lt; 10 m in diameter, and sulfur dioxide were obtained from centrally-located stationary monitors. <br>
Temporal relationships between air pollution levels and risk of cardiovascular malformations <br>
were modeled using Poisson generalized linear models. I observed a positive association between <br>
particulate matter &lt; 10 m in diameter and risk of patent ductus arteriosus (risk ratio for an <br>
increase in the interquartile range of the pollutant = 1.60, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.11, <br>
2.31). No other positive associations were observed.  <br>
