<h2><a name="general">General</a></h2>

<h3>Why do we want and need an ETD repository?</h3>

<p>The primary purpose of the ETD repository is to provide convenient access to one of the most important intellectual products of the university - masters theses and doctoral dissertations.  (It will also recognize the contributions of undergraduate scholars by collecting undergraduate honors theses.)  In the past, access to an Emory thesis or dissertation was quite limited.  Beyond reading the one copy held in Emory's library, interested (non-Emory) researchers could only acquire copies of theses and dissertations through interlibrary loan or by purchasing a paper or electronic copy of the document from UMI.  Moreover, it often took a number of months after the author's graduation before the academic community could access the document.  The ETD repository offers prompt web-based access to these documents, greatly increasing the visibility of our scholars and fulfilling our core mission: to contribute to academic scholarship.</p>

<h3>Will this new process be time consuming and complicated?</h3>

<p>No.  One of the primary goals of this project is to streamline the submission process.  Although the introduction of the ETD system will require the creation and submission of an electronic document, we anticipate that most users will be able to complete the ETD submission process in less than 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>Does this mean Emory will no longer keep paper copies of dissertations?</h3>

<p>Yes, eventually.  Emory's Library is attempting to control the growth of its ever-growing physical collections.  Replacing the library's bound paper copies of theses and dissertations with an electronic copy will create significant space savings, while actually increasing accessibility.  The library will not deposit a copy of your dissertation in the library stacks if you have created an ETD.  For the remainder of the pilot period (through fall 2008) a paper copy of the ETD theses and dissertations will be created by the library and deposited into University archives.  After the university-wide rollout of the ETD program the library will go paperless and all theses and dissertations will be available only in their electronic  form.</p>


<h2><a name="submission">Submission/Administrative Issues</a></h2>

<h3>Will this new process create new deadlines?</h3>

<p>No.  Your ETD will be due at the same time that you turn a paper copy of your document into the Graduate School for review.  (If you are unable to meet a deadline, you must get permission from the Graduate School to submit your work late.)  Students should submit their document to the ETD system prior to delivering a paper copy of the PDF to the Graduate School.  It is our hope that this new system will allow the Graduate School, in time, to set a later submission deadline.</p>

<h3>How does my committee approve my dissertation?</h3>

<p>There will be no change in this regard.  Your committee will continue to sign a paper document which you will need to turn into the Graduate School.</p>

<h3>Will we still submit our work to UMI/Proquest?</h3>

<p>Yes.  The current system will continue.  Your document will be microfilmed, indexed in Dissertations Abstracts, and, if you choose the Proquest's traditional submission method, a PDF of your document will be made available through Proquest, and will be available to the public for a fee.  (Proquest dissertations by Emory authors are available via a free download to Emory students and faculty.)  As an alternative to the traditional submission method, Proquest is creating its own open access dissertation repository, and for a fee you may deposit your dissertation there.  We expect most students interested in open access to bypass this paid Proquest service, since Emory will provide an identical service for free.</p>

<a name="help"><h3>Who can I contact for help if I have a problem submitting my dissertation?</h3></a>

<p>Most general questions about submission will be answered on
<a href="<?= $this->url(array("controller" => "docs", "action" => "instructions"), '', true); ?>"><strong>our instructions page.</strong></a></p>

<p>For problems with the ETD submission software, please submit your questions to the <a href="<?= $this->url(array("controller" => "help", "action" => "index"), '', true); ?>"><strong>online help form</strong></a>.</p>

<p>For general questions about submitting your thesis or dissertation, you should contact Queen Watson in the Graduate School.</p>

<p>For problems creating a PDF, please consult the support staff in ECIT,  the Cox Hall Computer Lab, or the Tech staff for your individual programs.</p>

<a name="changes"><h3>What if the Graduate School Requests Changes to
	My ETD?</h3></a>

<p>If the Graduate School requests changes to your ETD, be sure to edit your 
original submission.  DO NOT create a new record.  We carefully track the various events 
during the submission process, and creating a new record will interfere with this process.  
Please feel free to contact the ETD staff for assistance if necessary.</p>


<h2><a name="access">Access and Repository-related questions</a></h2>

<h3>How can I produce a bound paper copy?  What about my advisor or my department/program?</h3>

<p>The library will no longer be producing bound copies of theses and
dissertations for students (or for the library itself).  As a result,
authors will no longer be required to pay a binding fee or produce a
set number of bound copies.  Individual graduate programs may have
their own requirements with respect to students producing copies for
program/departmental libraries or for committee members.  To have
bound copies produced, you may make arrangements with the <a
href="<?= $this->url(array("action" => "boundcopies")); ?>">library's local binder</a>,
or you may choose to send your ETD to <a
href="<?= $this->url(array("action" => "boundcopies")); ?>">an online vendor</a>.
Examples of the work of the various vendors will be available in the
Graduate School.</p>

<h3>How will people access my dissertation?</h3>

<p>Most submissions to the ETD database will be classified as "Open Access."  This means they will be available on the web as a PDF file in their entirety.  While many searchers may come upon your document by using an internet search engine, most will access your document through the ETD website: etd.library.emory.edu.  This site will offer information and search tools that will allow researchers to find your work and that of your colleagues.  Your ETD will have a permanent URL to which you can refer colleagues, employers and other interested parties. </p>

<h3>What if I want to restrict access to my dissertation?</h3>

<p>There maybe a number of reasons that an author wishes to restrict access to his or her work, including patent pending, data sensitivity and pre-publication concerns.  The Graduate School has instituted an embargo system by which individual authors can ask that their work be kept out of the repository for a period of time.  Authors may choose (1) six months, (2) one year, (3) two years, (4) six years and under certain special circumstances, indefinitely.  The Graduate School will consider these requests on a case-by-case basis, and it is the responsibility of the author to consult with his or her advisor on this decision and to renew the request for an embargo should he or she want the original access restriction extended.  Access restrictions submitted to Emory must mirror the embargo period requested when submitting to Proquest/UMI.  Note: the Proquest form does not anticipate embargoes of six years or more.  Authors requesting such embargoes must contact Proquest directly to make those requests.</p>

<h3>What if I want to write a book related to my thesis or dissertation?</h3>

<p>Many authors, especially in the humanities, produce books from their dissertations.  Some publishers may have concerns about a thesis or dissertation on which a book is to be based having been previously available on the web.  We recommend, therefore, that you check with your publisher about whether depositing your document in the repository would jeopardize your publication plans in the future.  Because most books produced from dissertations require considerable revision, there is a strong argument that depositing a thesis or dissertation in the repository would not amount to a prior publication.</p>



<h2><a name="technical">Technical</a></h2>

<h3>How do I create an electronic version (i.e., a PDF) of my thesis/dissertation?</h3>

<p>In order to convert your thesis/dissertation to a PDF, you must use PDF creation software.  We strongly recommend that students create their PDFs using Adobe Acrobat Professional.  Copies of that program are available for your use in ECIT in the Woodruff Library, the Cox Hall Computer Lab, and in many cases, in your individual departments.  You may purchase your own copy of the Adobe Software through Emory.</p>

<h3>What if I am having problems creating a PDF?</h3>

<p>For problems creating a PDF, please consult the support staff in ECIT,  the Cox Hall Computer Lab, or the Tech staff for your individual programs.</p>

<h3>Once I have submitted my ETD, can I make corrections to the PDF?</h3>

<p>Since the ETD must be identical to the copy submitted to the Dean, you may not make corrections to the PDF file without permission or instructions from the Graduate School.</p>

<h3>Can I submit audio-visual files with my document?</h3>

<p>Yes, and we encourage such submissions.  All sound files, computer
	animations, and video files should be submitted as separate
	files.  Images and illustrations may be included in your PDF,
	but please do not imbed other audio-visual files within your
	PDF, because that may lead to problems later in preserving the
	document.  Please remember that for submissions of previously
	copyrighted materials that exceed the parameters of "Fair Use"
	as that term is used in U.S. Copyright law, submitters must
	obtain permission from rights holder. </p>

<h3>Can I include previously copyrighted images, illustrations, sound
files and datasets with my submission?</h3>

<p>Yes, in some cases.  Authors must receive permission from rights
holders to use audio-visual materials that are not the original work
of the author.  We have a sample permission letter in the <a
href="<?= $this->url(array("action" => "ip")); ?>">"Intellectual Property" section</a> of
the ETD site.  Receiving permission can take a significant period of
time, so be sure to request permission well in advance of publication.
The library has staff dedicated to help you answers questions you may
have about the submission of specific materials and would be pleased
to assist you.</p>
