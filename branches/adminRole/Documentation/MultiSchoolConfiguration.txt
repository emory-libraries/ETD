Multi-School Configuration
==========================

The ETD system includes content from several schools within the
university, and each school has its own ETD administrators, different
degrees awaraded, and variations in required fields.  Many of these
settings can now be set in the school configuration file.

Field Details
=============

 label   

   Used as the generic administrative agent for this school, including
   in ETD record history (when modified by an admin for this school),
   and in some of the email records.

 acl_id 

   Identifier used in Access Control List (ACL) for permissions.  Do
   not change this.

 db_id 	  

  How to identify students associated with this school; currently
  compared against academic career field in ESD. (do not change)

 fedora_collection

   Fedora collection PID; new objects associated with this school will
   be automatically added to this collection; existing objects are
   filtered by their collection membership and associated with the
   appropriate school configuration.

 admin
  
   How to identify administrative users for this school.  Currently
   supported fields:
     department 	department name in ESD
     netid		one or more user netids

     An admin is defined by the combination of department + netid.
     Department and netid must match the config file for the user to be an admin.
     

   Users matching the configured fields will be given the appropriate
   per-school admin role in the ETD site.  However, they will still
   need to be given etd-admin level permissions at the Fedora
   repository level specified in the permit-etd-admins xacml policy in
   order to view and modify records.
 
 degrees
 
   Should contain a list of degrees awarded by this school and
   expected to submit ETDs.  Currently has some redundancy with degree
   configuration file to map local degree names to those used by
   UMI/ProQuest and to associate degrees with genre terms.

 submission_fields
 
   Should contain a list of required fields; may also contain optional
   fields.  Required fields will be listed in the submission status
   checklist displayed on the site when an ETD record is in draft
   status, and must be filled out before the record can be submitted.
   Optional fields will be listed in the submission status checklist,
   but are not required to be filled out before the record can be
   submitted.  Fields that are not listed as either required or
   optional will generally not be available to be filled out.
