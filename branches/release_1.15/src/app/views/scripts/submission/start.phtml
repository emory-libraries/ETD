 <li> <!-- Question 1 -->
     <p>If your thesis or dissertation includes any text, audiovisual, or 
         other material not created by you or for which you no longer own 
         copyright, and which is not a fair use, you may need to seek permission 
         from the copyright owner.   NOTE:  All third party copyrighted 
         content should be properly cited, regardless of copyright status.</p>
     <p>These materials do not require permission:
     <ul>
         <li>Public domain materials (no longer protected by copyright)
            <ul>
               <li>Published in the US prior to 1923</li>
               <li>Unpublished materials when the author died more than 70 years ago</li>
               <li>Federal government documents created by a US government employee as part</li> 

            </ul>

         <li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> licensed materials used in accordance with their licences</li>

         <li>Photos you took and for which you currently own the copyright</li>
     </ul>
     </p>
     
     <p>You may typically rely on fair use to include these types of materials:
         <ul>
             <li>Short quotations of books, journal articles, poetry</li>
             <li>Film stills from movies</li>
             <li>Graphs, charts and tables of facts</li>
              <li>Screenshots of web pages (unless they include proprietary information)</li>
              <li>Materials which are integral to the argument being made (not simply illustrative), using no more than is necessary to make the argument</li>
         </ul>
</p>


<p>You may need permission to include these types of materials:
         <ul>
            <li>Images, particularly from ArtStor, other licensed databases, or archives and museums</li>
            <li>Articles or other materials you authored, but for which you no longer own copyright --  most common are journal articles where copyright was transferred to the publisher</li>
            <li>Long quotations of a page or more from a book</li>
            <li>Unpublished materials when the author died less than 70 years ago</li>
            <li>Poetry or music lyrics when used in their entirety or without comment or criticism</li>
            <li>Musical scores or sound recordings</li>
            <li>Computer Code without an open license</li>

<!-- Questions 3 -->
<li><p>The ETD repository allows two levels of access restriction on your work: 
        full or partial. With a partial access restriction, your abstract 
        and/or table of contents are available to the public, but the full 
        text of your thesis/dissertation is not available for viewing or 
        download until your access restriction expires. A full access 
        restriction allows you to restrict access to the abstract, table of 
        contents, and full text for the duration of the restriction period. 
        NOTE: All access restrictions must be approved by your advisor prior 
        to submission.</p>
    
    <p>Are you requesting an access restriction (see Part 3 below) for your 
        thesis or dissertation?</p>

    <div id="embargo_yes">    <? /* display if answer to embargo is yes */ ?>
     <p>Should your abstract and/or table of contents be included in the access restriction?</p>
     
     <p>NOTE: You will specify your requested access restriction (full, table 
         of contents and/or abstract) later in the ETD record creation process.</p>
