<b>Abstract</b> <br> <br>Diola villagers in Guinea-Bissau have long been recognized for their capacity to grow <br>rice in their landscape of tangled mangroves and thick oil palm forests.  Recently, <br>declining rainfall, desertification, and widespread erosion have increasingly challenged <br>their ability to provision themselves through long-established wet rice cultivation <br>practices.  The effects of these ecological shifts are exacerbated by increased youth <br>migration, national political instability, and the simultaneous increasing demands of a <br>cash economy and declining overall economic security.   <br> <br>Based on two years of ethnographic research in Guinea-Bissau, this dissertation begins <br>with the recognition, shared by most residents in the region, that Diola villagers are <br>currently challenged to maintain a way of life that has largely worked well for many <br>centuries.  Diola see their sustenance system not simply as a means of survival, but as <br>integrally tied to their conceptions of personhood, social relations, ritual obligations, and <br>collective cultural identity.  What do Diola villagers do when the actions that define a <br>worthy person are no longer tenable?  What happens when they find that many of the <br>premises of their society are working against them?  How does a cultural group maintain <br>itself<i> </i>as such<i> </i>when the values that have long defined its members are under severe <br>pressure?  This ethnography tells a complex and often contradictory story about Diola <br>responses to these challenges by examining three central crises underway in Diola-land. <br> <br>First, I consider Diola responses to changes in their environment that impinge upon their <br>ability to maintain their long-held system of rice agriculture.  The second part examines <br>Christian missionary presence in Diola-land, and particularly how Diola Christians <br>negotiate the different orientations and opportunities of village and mission life.  The <br>final section explores a conflict between Diola and Fula residents in this region, and <br>explicates Diola values regarding social incorporation and exclusion.   <br> <br>Across these sites of analysis, this study explores which social forms are reproduced, <br>which boundaries are maintained or redrawn, and how such processes are continually <br>contested.  Through specific ethnographic examples that have direct bearing on current <br>Diola lives these three stories collectively engage broader questions about conflict, social <br>change and continuity.   <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
