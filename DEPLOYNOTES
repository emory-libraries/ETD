INSTALLATION NOTES
==================
ETD requires that fedora-commons be configured as follows:
   - RIsearch enabled, with sync updates turned on
   - xacml enforcement enabled and combining algorithm set to ordered, permit overrides
   (set XACML-COMBINING-ALGORITHM to com.sun.xacml.combine.OrderedPermitOverridesPolicyAlg
   in fedora.fcfg)
 - etd repository-wide policies (in src/fedora-policies) should be
   included in xacml policies, and default policy to allow all API-A
   should be disabled.  Recommended: check this out of svn and replace
   default fedora xacml policies https://svn.library.emory.edu/svn/fedora/repository-policies/
 - Fedora 3.x requires a patch to allow cmodel xacml filtering
 - working LDAP authentication filter
 - custom ESD DeptData filter
 - Generic Search Service installed; use index script src/public/xslt/etdFoxmlToSolr.xslt
   - Solr instance, with schema from src/scripts/solr-schema.xml
 - ETD control objects (cmodel/sdef/sdep) loaded

Site webroot should be pointed at src/public
 - requires apache override, mod_rewrite
 - copy src/htaccess-sample to public/.htaccess and edit
 - edit config files in src/config
    - copy *.xml.example to *.xml and edit
    - which section of the config file is loaded depends on mode
      setting in environment.xml

Update the ETD control objects for particular fedora instance.
    (1) emory-control:ETD-metadataTransform/datastreams/WSDL

        Update the "location" param for the particular instance of Fedora

        <wsdl:service name="FedoraSaxon">
         <wsdl:port binding="this:FedoraSaxon_http" name="FedoraSaxon_port">
           <http:address location="http://fedora.library.emory.edu:8080/saxon/"></http:address>
         </wsdl:port>
        </wsdl:serVIce>

        Note: For wsdl:operation: "getMarcxml", "getEtdms" and "getMods", clear-stylesheet-cache should be set to "no" unless the xslt files are being tested.

    (2) emory-control:ETD-metadataTransform/datastreams/METHODMAP
        In the sections "getMarcxml", "getEtdms" and "getMods" update the "defaultValue" param to point to the coresponding xsl file for the particular enviroment.

        Example:
        <fmm:Method operationLabel="getMarcxml" operationName="getMarcxml">
           <fmm:DatastreamInputParm label="xml datastream" parmName="MODS" passBy="URL_REF" required="true"></fmm:DatastreamInputParm>
           <fmm:DefaultInputParm defaultValue="http://etd.library.emory.edu/xslt/mods2marc21.xsl" parmName="xslt" passBy="VALUE" required="true"></fmm:DefaultInputParm>
           <fmm:MethodReturnType wsdlMsgName="xslt_response" wsdlMsgTOMIME="text/xml"></fmm:MethodReturnType>
        </fmm:Method>


    (3) emory-control::ETDformattedMetadataParts/datastreams/WSDL

        Update the "location" param for the particular enviroment

        Example:
        <wsdl:service name="XmlById">
           <wsdl:port binding="this:XmlById_http" name="XmlById_port">
               <http:address location="https://etd.library.emory.edu/services/xmlbyid/view/"></http:address>
           </wsdl:port>
        </wsdl:service>


* Update GSearch with latest version of src/public/xslt/etdFoxmlToSolr.xslt.
  Note that the xslt now requires a parameter containing the Fedora base url
  to be set in REPOSITORYURL.  You must edit this parameter if Fedora should
  be accessed somewhere other than this default:
        http://localhost:8080/fedora/ .  It looks like at least for the staging
        environment, the hostname will not work. You must use localhost.


DOCKER/ETD LOCAL SETUP NOTES
=================
Author: Yang Li
Email: yli60@emory.edu
Date: 09/07/2016

ETD is contained in a Docker, and the best way to have it running locally is to ask for help from James.

** (Wildcard?) Registry certificate CA issues OSX / Virtualbox #805 **
https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/issues/805

** Problems using a custom boot2docker ISO hosted on an internal HTTPS site with self-signed cert #491**
https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/491#issuecomment-76256467

** Deploying a Registry Server **
https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/deploying.md#running-a-domain-registry

The way to pull down Docker image and run the container, from James:

`docker pull --name=etd_webserver bela.library.emory.edu:5001/jbias/etd_webserver`

`sudo docker run  --restart=always  -it  -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 --name=etd_webserver bela.library.emory.edu:5001/jbias/etd_webserver`

However I got a response from the registry that:

`sudo docker run  --restart=always  -it  -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 --name=etd_webserver bela.library.emory.edu:5000/jbias/etd
Unable to find image 'bela.library.emory.edu:5000/jbias/etd:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: Get https://bela.library.emory.edu:5000/v1/_ping: EOF.`

I kept getting the error from the daemon that the Docker registry returned an error response. It made me think that it is me being declined by the registry during the authentication process.

With some research I realized that it is the Docker registry being insecure that rejected connection. There are essentially two ways to work around it:
- Feed a valid certificate
- Let the Docker registry take insecure connections

The first solution is a little tricky because we are using a Mac and on OS X the imported certificate, managed by KeyChain, cannot be easily handled by Docker. And setting the file in `/etc/docker/cert.d/` doesn’t seem to work well either because OS X is different from Ubuntu or other Linux distributions.

With the second method I have tried to pass Optional parameters to the Docker daemon but it didn’t seem like Docker picked them up. As it turns out, when I installed the Docker on the Mac with the official installer, there is a place in the Docker daemon monitor to add insecure registry. So I added a new entry with `'bela.library.emory.edu:5000/'`and it started to work well.

File Locations in the ETD Docker

** /etc/httpd/sites.d/ **

Apache site specific configurations. The `namevirtualhost443.conf` is the one for HTTPS and the `namevirtualhost.conf` is for HTTP.

`/etc/httpd/sites.d/namevirtualhost443.conf` In the `namevirtualhost443.conf` we need to add a line that defines the `DirectoryIndex`, and it should be something like:
    ` DirectoryIndex index.php`

If we do run into LDAP certificate issues it is possible to work around it by setting:
     `SetEnv LDAPTLS_REQCERT never`
to not let Apache validate the `LDAPTLS_REQCERT`

Also in this file pay attention to these entries:
     `SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/sites.d/ssl/library.emory.edu.crt
     SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/sites.d/ssl/wildcard.prm
     SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/httpd/sites.d/ssl/gd_bundle.crt`
Make sure that the certs do exist and are valid.

In the `<Directory /home/httpd/phpinfo> `block we should make sure that we have the user’s IP defined in the Allow list. Or for a safe sandbox we can also try Allow from All

**/etc/httpd/sites.d/namevirtualhost.conf**

It might be helpful to have  LogLevel debug turned on in the Apache configuration file to collect more debugging information. Also make sure that irrelevant or conflicting entries in the configuration files are commented out correctly. It is important that we do restart the Apache service after we make changes to the configuration files, and the way to restart it could be done by stopping the Docker container and restarting it.

** /etc/httpd/logs/ **

This is where Apache stores its logs. They are very helpful when we get errors connecting to the web server.

** /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf **

There was a problem that when I tried to access the HTTPS version of the application, it takes me to the Apache placeholder page but not the actual ETD application page. The ETD configuration does exist and is setup correctly. However in the Apache log it prompts that there was an overriding configuration `Virtualhost` at 443, and it turns out to be that in this file, there is a default HTTPS profile defined. All we need to do is to comment out the relevant profile for HTTPS and make the ETD profile the only active profile.

** /home/httpd/etd **

This is the home directory of the ETD source code.

** /home/httpd/etd/src/public/.htaccess **

If the server reports there is a 500 Internal Server Error when you the execute search functionality, it could be an error as an infinite redirect loop in the `.htaccess` configuration file. And the solution for this problem is to change the default Rewrite from `/home/httpd/etd/` to `/`.

It needs to be:
`copy this file to public/.htaccess and update for the local installation.
in particular, edit this url path to point to your project relative to the
webroot:
RewriteBase /`

** /etc/openldap/ldap.conf **
This is where the LDAP configuration lives. Ideally we should obtain a working copy of this file from a server but there are some certificate issues as the application communicates with the LDAP server. A quick workaround would be to disable the certificate validation with:
    `TLS_REQCERT never`
And this will allow LDAP to authenticate without using valid certificates.

** /etc/php.ini **

There is one setting about `compatability_mode` for Zend framework and we need to set it to Off as:
     `sybase.compatability_mode = Off`

** APP_ROOT/src/lib/Emory/View/Helper/LinkTo.php **

`Zend_View_Helper_LinkTo` was declared twice according to the apache log file and a temporary solution was to comment out the linkTo helper in the code (so that it doesn't trigger the search for this helper). However I cannot find the place where this module is loaded twice in the application.

** APP_ROOT/src/config/config.xml **

Next one is when I attempt to login as a superuser. The first step is to add my username into the `config.xml` so that it has entry `<user>yli60</user>`.

** PHP Error Output **

`// NOTE: php is now outputting a notice when using __set on arrays / objects
// (actual logic seems to work properly)
error_reporting(-1);
// error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE);`

This is in `APP_ROOT/src/public/index.php` directory and the `error_reporting` can be set to `-1` to print all error messages on the screen in the UI, which can be very handy at times.

** APP_ROOT/src/config/config.xml **
This is where the configuration for the ETD lives. Collect one that is working from a developer (e.g. Jay) and make appropriate updates such as the feeds like so:

```
<news_feed>
  <url>http://web.library.emory.edu/etd-static/news-feed.rss</url>
  <lifetime>3600</lifetime>
</news_feed>
<docs_feed>
 <url>http://web.library.emory.edu/etd-static/pages-feed.rss</url>
  <lifetime>3600</lifetime>
</docs_feed>
```

** APP_ROOT/logs/etd_log.xml **

This is the log file for the ETD application and it's set in the `config.xml` file. It might appear funny but we need to create the directory and touch the file if it doesn't exist, so that the application can write into it. Or otherwise it might not create this file and it appears that the log file is never created.

** APP_ROOT/src/lib/Emory/View/Helper/LinkTo.php **

In the Apache log `Zend_View_Helper_LinkTo` was claimed to have been declared twice according and a temporary solution was to comment out the `linkTo` helper in the code (so that it doesn't trigger the search for this helper). However I cannot find the place where this module is loaded twice in the application.

      $ri = $fedora->risearch;
      file_put_contents("/tmp/ETD.txt", implode("\n",  $ri->findByCModel("emory-control:ETD-1.0")));
      file_put_contents("/tmp/ETDFile.txt", implode("\n",  $ri->findByCModel("emory-control:EtdFile-1.0")));
      file_put_contents("/tmp/ETDAuthorInfo.txt", implode("\n",  $ri->findByCModel("emory-control:AuthorInformation-1.0")));

    - Make sure there is a carriage return on the last line of each file.
    - cd /tmp
    - cat ETD.txt  ETDFile.txt ETDAuthorInfo.txt  > ETDPids.txt

    - Copy pids listed in ETDPids.txt to fedora3.4
    - Copy /tmp/ETD.txt  /tmp/ETDFile.txt /tmp/ETDAuthorInfo.txt to fedora3.4

    - Run the fedora-rebuild.sh script for these options:
      2) Rebuild SQL database.
      1) Rebuild the Resource Index.
      Make sure then the new objects show up in the rebuilt count.
      If the objects are not indexed, then they will not be found for the next step.

    - Run the inline to managed conversion script on the three etd pid files in fedora 3.4
      Make sure the environment variables are set if available this script will
      set them to the correct value ". /home/fedora34/set-env-for-this-fedora.sh"

      /home/fedora34/server/bin/fedora-modify-control-group.sh

      managedConversion.log      - you many have to use http for the 2nd param

   - Make sure to copy over these addition pids as well but do
     not run the managed migration on them:
      emory-control:ETD-collection
      emory-control:ETD-GradSchool-collection
      emory-control:ETD-College-collection
      emory-control:ETD-Candler-collection
      emory-control:ETD-Rollins-collection
      emory:17r1x

* Install ESDFilter on tomcat
    See Documentation/README-ESDFilter

* Update the ETD content model services for particular fedora instance.
    (1) emory-control:ETD-metadataTransform/datastreams/WSDL/content
    (2) emory-control::ETDformattedMetadataParts/datastreams/WSDL/content
    <wsdl:port binding="this:FedoraSaxon_http" name="FedoraSaxon_port">
    <http:address location="localhost:8080/saxon/"/>
    </wsdl:port>
    If the location parameter is not the default location adjust accordingly.

* Update GSearch with latest version of src/public/xslt/etdFoxmlToSolr.xslt.
  Note that the xslt now requires a parameter containing the Fedora base url
  to be set in REPOSITORYURL.  You must edit this parameter if Fedora should
  be accessed somewhere other than this default:
        http://localhost:8080/fedora/ .  It looks like at least for the staging
        environment, the hostname will not work. You must use localhost.

*  Reindex gSearch by running the ETD reindex script:
    - cd src/scripts
    - php ./re-index.php

*  Reload the XACML policies by running the script 002-clean_xacml.php.
   Note: this script will produce a php memory error, so use the -s option
   with 1-9, to run by selected grouping.

    - cd src/scripts/migrations
    - php ./002-clean_xacml.php -s 1 -v debug > /tmp/etd_xacml_policy_update.log
    - php ./002-clean_xacml.php -s 2 -v debug >> /tmp/etd_xacml_policy_update.log
    - . . . etc
    - php ./002-clean_xacml.php -s 9 -v debug >> /tmp/etd_xacml_policy_update.log

    When the scripts are finished, search output log for the error terms "ERR",
    and  "Could not connect to host", noting the pids.
    Run the script with the pids that got an error:
    - Format: php ./002-clean_xacml.php -p '{pid}' -v debug >> /tmp/etd_xacml_policy_update.log
    - Example: php ./002-clean_xacml.php -p 'emory:12345' -v debug >> /tmp/etd_xacml_policy_update.log
    - STOP HERE and make sure all errors have been resolved.

*  Run the checksum script to perform any checksum updates to FILE datastreams.
   (this will take some time and should be run overnight)
   cd src/scripts
   ./update_checksum.php -v info -u


Version 1.8.5
-------------
* Using the new reindex.php script that can be used to update the GSearch index
  for all ETD content requires updating config/fedora.xml
  with the gsearch index and repository name; see fedora.xml.example.

Version 1.8.3
-------------
* Run the migration scripts to add two new programs the emory college school:
    - 018-add-programs.php

Version 1.8.1
-------------
* Edit the programs collection (emory:17r1x) and delete the last version of the SKOS datastream.
* Run the migration scripts to reload the rollins school data:
    - 015-add-rollins-programs.php
    - 016-add_prog_codes_to_skos.php
* Delete all the records from etd_admins in the etd database
* Reload the data by running DB/002-load_init_data.php

Version 1.8
-----------
* Update fedora policies under FEDORA_HOME to new branch and restart Fedora:
   - staging: https://svn.library.emory.edu/svn/fedora/repository-policies/branches/etd_1.8.x
   - production: https://svn.library.emory.edu/svn/fedora/repository-policies/tags/etd_1.8
