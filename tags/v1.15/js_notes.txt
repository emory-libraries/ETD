Notes on Javascript usage within ETD
====================================

FCKeditor is used html editing on ETD title, abstract, and table of
contents. 

Prototype/Scriptaculous is used for older dynamic portions of the
site.

jQuery is used for newer dynamic portions of the site (updated when
XForms and Dojo were removed).
