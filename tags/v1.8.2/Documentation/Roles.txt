User Roles in ETD
=================

There are several main roles within ETD, plus certain roles that are
context-specific.

A user's base role is determined by the user type code for their
account that is pulled from Emory Shared Data.  (See
src/app/models/esdPerson.php for more details)

Base Roles
==========

 guest 
   
   Users who are not logged in are treated as guests, and can view
   public content: published records and files without access
   restrictions.

 student
  
   Students are allowed to create a new ETD record.  The 'My ETDs'
   page should display their record(s).  All users with type codes
   that could possibly be receiving a degree are considered students.

 faculty

   Faculty do not have any special privileges.  The 'My ETDs' page
   should list any ETDs where they are a committee member or chair OR
   any records where they are the author.  Faculty are allowed to
   create ETD submissions, since sometimes faculty are finishing
   degrees.
  
 staff

   Staff do not have any special privileges.  Certain staff may be
   program coordinators (see below).


 admin

   Administrators manage ETDs; they can see all records in any state,
   and can run the appropriate workflow steps on ETDs in the correct
   state (e.g., reviewing submitted ETDs or approving records that
   have been reviewed).  Admins have access to the 'manage' page that
   summarizes ETD records by status, as well as giving access to
   reports and other functionality.  Admins other than library staff
   should generally be a per-school admin.  (see below?)

 tech support

   Tech support users are specified in the config file, and have
   permissions needed to help students with problems submitting and
   editing records-- access to view records in any state, to edit
   metadata fields, and view the manage page and the site log.

 report viewer

  Report viewers have access to the list of reports (usually
  accessible from the manage page for admins).  They have no other
  special privileges, and cannot view ETD records that are not
  published or that are embargoed.

 superuser

  ETD superuser can do anything in the system (including running admin
  workflow steps on an ETD in the wrong state, or editing a user's
  contact information to correct an error causing system problems).
  This level of access should be used sparingly & carefuly.


Extended roles
==============

 student with submission

   Students who have an unpublished ETD record get this role, which
   extends the base student role; they are no longer allowed to create
   a new ETD record (only one draft is allowed at a time), and they
   are allowed to do submission-related tasks that cannot be done
   until a submission has been created (e.g., editing contact
   information in author information object).

 per-school admins

   Most administrators should be associated with a particular School,
   e.g. the Graduate School, Emory College Honors, or Candler School
   of Theology.  (See multi-school configuration document for more
   details).  For a per-school admin, 'manage' page is filtered so
   they only see records associated with their school.


ETD-specific roles
==================

  In addition to these base roles, a user may have a role in relation
  to a particular ETD, which gives them special privileges on that
  record ONLY.  Note that these ETD-specific roles will override base
  role permissions *except* for superuser (e.g., a tech support user
  will not be able to perform normal tech support tasks on an ETD
  where they are the author).

  author

   An author can always view their ETD record, no matter what status
   it is in, and can view embargoed portions of the record.  An author
   can edit a draft ETD, and can edit their contact information at any
   time.

  committee

   Committee chairs & members can view all portions (including those
   with access restricted) of ETD records in any status.  However,
   they can not view the ETD author's contact information.
   
  program coordinator

   Staff members who are specified as program coordinators will have
   special privileges for ETD records that belong to their department
   or program.  For a program coordinator, the 'My ETDs' page will
   list all unpublished ETD records in their program.  Program
   coordinators have access to view all portions of ETDs (except
   contact information) in any status, in order to help support the
   students in their program as they submit ETD records.  

   A user is designated as a program coordinator by a special table in
   Emory Shared Data set up between UTS and the Graduate School.


How access works
================

Because ETD access Fedora using the logged in user's credentials,
authorization and authentication actually happens at two different
levels.  All those roles that require special privileges at the Fedora
level (e.g., viewing unpublished content, editing records) require
some kind of permissions at the Fedora level.  Where possible, this
has been done by repository-wide XACML policies, but in the case of
per-ETD permissions it has to be done by per-object POLICY
datastreams.

 repository-wide policies

  All admins, superusers, and tech support users should be listed in
  the permit-etds-if-etdadmin policy as etd admins.  ETD superusers
  should be listed as etd superusers.  If this is not done, a user may
  appear to have access when logging in to the ETD site, but will get
  errors when they try to access Fedora content that is not viewable
  by guests.

  The owner of an object (author) has special permissions-- e.g.,
  access to the normally locked down authorInformation object, view
  access to the records that they created.

 per-object policies

  Committee and program coordinator permissions are handled by setting
  committee netids and program names in the POLICY datastream on ETD
  records and sub-objects, to give them the appropriate level of
  access.  The program coordinator field is picked up from ESD in a
  custom Fedora filter that allows us to use it as a filter for xacml
  policies.
