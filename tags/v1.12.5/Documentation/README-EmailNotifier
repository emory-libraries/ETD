Services in ETD
===============
* The notifier is a mechanism to send emails to authors, committee members, admins etc.
* The body of each email is configured in a template located in the src/app/views/scripts/email directory
* The recipients are configured using the function setRecipients(<CODE>); in the function for each
  email type located in src/app/models/etd_notifier.php
* The <CODE> defines the list of recipients.  For example the code "author"
  will send email to the author's permanent email and the author's emory email.
* Embargo expiration emails are sent 60 days, 7 days before the embargo expires and the day it expires.

Testing
-------
* You can seen an example of the content of different types of emails by going to
  Manage > View Email templates

* While in development mode only the configured email address will receive emails.
  You must have your email configured in the config.xml see bellow:
  in config.xml:

	  <email>
	    <etd>
	       <address>etd-admin@listserv.cc.emory.edu</address>
	       <name>ETD ADMIN</name>
	    </etd>
        <ott>
	       <address>ott-web@emory.edu</address>
	       <name>Emory Office of Technology Transfer</name>
	    </ott>
	    <test><YOUR-EMAIL></test>
	  </email>

* To test embargo emails, you must run the script  php ./embargo_expiration.php
  * Use -n for noact mode, -h for more info

* You man have to modify the following elements in the MODS data stream to make
 an etd eligible for an embargo email:

<mods:dateOther type="embargoedUntil">2011-02-23</mods:dateOther>
- This has to be within the 60, 7 or 0 day window to test embargo emails

<mods:note type="admin" ID="embargo_expiration_notice">sent 2011-02-02</mods:note></mods:mods>
- If present, it indicates the embargo email has been sent for this etd and it
  will not be sent again unless the element is removed.
