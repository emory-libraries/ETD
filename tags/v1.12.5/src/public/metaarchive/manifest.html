<p>
The collection "Emory Electronic Theses and Dissertations" is divided into Archival Units by year of publication.  The LOCKSS plugin crawls 
a browse listing of publicly available ETDs for the given year and harvests the ETD splash pages, linked ETDs (Adobe Acrobat), and linked supplementary materials. 
</p>

<p>
Embargoed ETDs are not included until the embargo has expired.  Original file formats for ETDs (e.g. MS Word, LaTeX) are not included at this time.  XML formatted
 metadata (MODS and DC) are kept in the underlying data store (Fedora Commons) but are not at this time publicly viewable, and hence not yet being harvested into
MetaArchive.

<p>This collection is growing.</p>
