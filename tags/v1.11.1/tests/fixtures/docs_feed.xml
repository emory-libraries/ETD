    <title>Instructions for Electronic Submission of your Thesis/Dissertation</title>
    <link>https://digital.library.emory.edu/content/etd/instructions</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;1. Be sure to turn in to the Laney Graduate School all paper forms (including a paper   copy of the PDF file you will upload to the ETD system) immediately after your   electronic submission. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.graduateschool.emory.edu/resources/progress.php?id=7&quot;&gt;Graduate School Instructions&lt;/a&gt; on their website for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Before you proceed, make sure that you have all necessary files: (1) your   thesis or dissertation in &lt;strong&gt;PDF&lt;/strong&gt; form; (2) Your thesis or dissertation    in &lt;strong&gt;Original&lt;/strong&gt; Form -- usually Microsoft Word; and (3) any &lt;strong&gt;supplemental   files&lt;/strong&gt; such as   datasets, audio, video, etc. (optional). You will also need a non-Emory e-mail    address where you can be contacted after you graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. PDF Creation:&lt;br /&gt; a) Avoid using PDF creation software other than Adobe Acrobat&lt;br /&gt; b) Do not scan pages and append them to your PDF. Your PDF should contain    NO signatures.&lt;br /&gt; c) You may choose to imbed keywords when creating your PDF    document by editing &quot;subject&quot; or &quot;keywords&quot; in the document    properties section in Adobe Acrobat.  These keyword will be extracted from the    document upon upload. This is optional.  You may add your keywords manually later in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. To begin the process, go to etd.library.emory.edu and login using your Emory   network ID and password at the top of the page. A &quot;Submit Your Thesis&quot; Link   should appear on the left side of the page. Click on that link to begin your   submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. The process begins by uploading your PDF. Click on &quot;Browse&quot;; to   locate your file, and then click on &quot;Begin.&quot; There will be a momentary   delay as the system reads your file: you should see a note in green on   the screen that says &quot;Processing.&quot; &lt;strong&gt;Since the system is extracting   information from your PDF file, it is essential that your document follow the   order dictated by the Laney Graduate School:&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;, Distribution   Agreement, Approval Sheet, Dissertation/Thesis Abstract Cover Sheet, Abstract,   Dissertation/Thesis Cover Page, Acknowledgments, Table of Contents,    Dissertation/Thesis Body).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important: &lt;strong&gt; for security reasons, do not include any digitized signatures in your document.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. The submission summary page shows your submission in its preliminary form.   You will see various edit links and the Submission Status Box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://etd.library.emory.edu/images/submit_preview.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should review all the pre-populated information for accuracy, and then   proceed with your submission by supplying the information requested under each &quot;edit&quot; link.   (You may also proceed through your submission by clicking on the items in the   Submission Status Box.) Each completed section will be marked with a green check   mark, and each incomplete section will be marked with a red &quot;x.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: throughout the submission process, required fields are BOLD usually marked with       an asterisk (*) and invalid entries in fields will be flagged in red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Contact Information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We collect this information primarily for ProQuest. When your submission is     sent to ProQuest, they may need to contact you for various reasons. The default     address in this section will be pulled from your Emory record. You may edit     your current and permanent address as needed. Be sure to include the date     valid for your permanent address.&lt;br /&gt; The permanent email address is especially important. If you are requesting   an access restriction, you will receive an e-mail from the library at that   address 60 days prior to the expiration of the access restriction to inform   you that your document will be released via the internet. You are responsible for letting the library know if your contact e-mail address changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Title/Edit Abstract/Edit Table of Contents:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In these sections, you may make changes to your title, abstract or table of   contents if necessary. Be sure to limit your abstract to 350 words (as required by ProQuest/UMI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure to review your abstract and title of contents for any formatting errors produced by uploading your files. In particular, pay attention to special characters included in your ETD record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Thesis Information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; a)  You may choose to change your name as it appears in your ETD record.&lt;br /&gt; b)  Please enter the language in which your thesis or dissertation is written&lt;br /&gt; c) Enter keywords (or phrases) to help researchers locate your work in the   repository. Enter ONLY one word or phrase in the input box. Click on &quot;add   another keyword&quot; for additional phrases. DO NOT enter multiple words in   the box separated by commas. ProQuest collects up to six keywords, but you   may enter more in the system if you choose. We will send the first six to ProQuest.   If you are restricting access to your thesis or dissertation, remember that the keywords you enter here will not be restricted: they will displayed in the public record of your thesis or dissertation.&lt;br /&gt; d)  Enter the degree you will be receiving this submission period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Committee Chair &amp;amp; Members:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The system will attempt to extract the names of your committee chair(s) and    members from your PDF. If it cannot make a match, you will need to enter these   manually. For each faculty member, enter their last name and then wait while   the system locates them. If you cannot locate a faculty member on the drop down suggestor, you should enter them in the &quot;Non-Emory Faculty Member&quot; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;edit_rights&quot;&gt;Edit Rights and Restrictions:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the Author Rights and Access Restrictions page:&lt;br /&gt; a) Indicate whether you have requested an access restriction on your submission     form. The Laney Graduate School will enter the term of the restriction upon approval.&lt;br /&gt; b) Indicate whether you would like ProQuest to register your copyright for     you. This requires the payment of a fee. See ProQuest submission materials     for form. (Note that this is optional, but recommended.)&lt;br /&gt; c) Check off the box for submission agreement. This section is intended to   remind you of what you have agreed to in the Emory submission form.&lt;br /&gt; d) If you are opting to restrict access to your abstract and/or table of contents, check the appropriate box(es).       &lt;em&gt;(Note: You will also need to contact ProQuest about restricting access to your abstract.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Research Fields:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ProQuest requires that you submit at least one and up to three research fields.     Choose the fields by clicking on each enumerated field; your choices will     appear at the top of the page. The first field you choose will be designated     your &quot;primary&quot; field. You may drag and drop fields in your list     to rearrange their order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Program:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The system will attempt to extract the name of your graduate program from your   Emory record. If the entry in this section is missing or incorrect, you should   enter it manually by search for your program by division/discipline/program (e.g., Graduate =&amp;gt;Humanities =&amp;gt;English).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Files:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You must upload a copy of your thesis or dissertation in original format. You   may do this by clicking on either the &quot;original file&quot; link in the   submission box or the &quot;add another file&quot; link in the files section   at the bottom of the submission summary page. Upload your file using the browse button on the &quot;Add File to Record&quot; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also &lt;strong&gt;add supplemental files&lt;/strong&gt; on this page. Choose &quot;supplemental   file&quot; from the &quot;type of file to add&quot; dropdown list and proceed   to upload.&lt;br /&gt; After upload, you may edit the author and document description fields if you   choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you mistakenly upload a file&lt;/strong&gt;, use the replace function in  the files section of   your main record page. This function allows you to swap a new file into the record.   You do not need to delete your original file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: most users will upload their thesis or dissertation as a single PDF.   &lt;em&gt;In the unusual event that sections of the document (rather than the entirety)   need to be embargoed&lt;/em&gt;, you should initially (upon entering the system for the   first time) upload the first section of your thesis or dissertation so that   the system can extract the necessary data from your document. You should use   the edit files section here to upload the additional PDF files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Once your record is complete, a &quot;Review &amp;amp; Submit&quot; Link   will appear on the page below the Submission Status Box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://etd.library.emory.edu/images/Review.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review and submit link will bring you to the review page where you will   have a final opportunity to edit any of your data or upload files. If you need   to change anything, click on the edit link, and you will be brought back to   the edit page for that section. When you are done editing, click on &quot;review &amp;amp; submit&quot; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. If you are satisfied with your submission, you should click on the &quot;submit&quot; button   at the bottom of the page. It is important to note that once your document   is submitted you may no longer edit it without the Graduate School&#039;s   approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. You will receive an email to confirm that your document has been submitted.   &lt;strong&gt;In the event that the Graduate School requests changes&lt;/strong&gt;, your document will   be returned to draft status. Do not attempt to submit a new record. You should   use the replace file function in the files section of your main record page, and   upload a corrected version, and proceed with your submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. You will receive e-mails upon approval. You may check on the status of   your submission by viewing your record under the &quot;My ETDs&quot; section   of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. After your graduation has been confirmed, your record will appear in the     repository. If you chose the Open Access option, the full text of your document     will be immediately available in PDF form. If you requested an access restriction,     a link to your PDF will not appear in your record until the access restriction     period expires.&lt;br /&gt; By default, all ETD records, restricted access as well as open access, will display information about your dissertation or thesis, such as author, title, committee, program, abstract, and table of contents. If you want  to restrict access to your abstract and/or table of contents, you must specify this during the uploading process (see above, &lt;a href=&quot;#edit_rights&quot;&gt;Edit Rights and Restrictions&lt;/a&gt;). NOTE: the access restriction expires automatically, and it is the author&#039;s responsibility to request extensions, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Obtaining Bound Copies of Your Theses and Dissertations</title>
    <link>https://digital.library.emory.edu/content/etd/boundcopies</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to introduce more flexibility into the process of creating bound copies of theses and dissertations, Emory University Libraries and the Graduate School have decided to offer authors more choices for having paper copies of their work produced.  In the past, all students have been asked to pay to have four copies of their work bound. Students submitting electronically will no longer face this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due to space constraints, the library will no longer retain a bound copy of theses and dissertations for which an electronic copy is available, and therefore authors will not be asked to produce bound copies for the Emory Libraries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors interested in having bound copies of their thesis or dissertation produced for themselves, their committee members, or their department/program libraries can consult the vendors below. Although we have examined the work of the vendors listed on this page, we cannot endorse any particular entity. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list.  We encourage authors to explore a variety of vendors in order to obtain copies of their theses and dissertations at a price and quality that meets their satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The HF Group Inc.:     &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesisondemand.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.thesisondemand.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PhD Book Binding:      &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phdbookbinding.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.phdbookbinding.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The National Library Bindery Co.&lt;br /&gt; 100 Hembree Park Drive&lt;br /&gt; P.O. Box 428&lt;br /&gt; Roswell, GA  30076&lt;br /&gt; 770-442-5490&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Policies and Procedures</title>
    <link>https://digital.library.emory.edu/content/etd/policies</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Electronic Theses and Dissertations program is a joint program of the   Emory Libraries, the Laney Graduate School, Emory College of Arts and Sciences and the Candler School of Theology. For all questions   relating to graduation requirements and the preparation of your thesis or dissertation,   please refer your questions to the administration of of your school or program, or your individual graduate program (or undergraduate department).   For questions regarding the electronic submission of your thesis or dissertation,   please contact the Emory Library through our ETD listserv email:   &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:etd-help@listserv.cc.emory.edu&quot;&gt;etd-help@listserv.cc.emory.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I. Policies and Procedures for Graduate Students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gs.emory.edu/resources/progress.php?id=7&quot;&gt;Graduate    School website&lt;/a&gt; to see the prerequisites for graduation,     instructions on preparing your theses and dissertations, links to necessary     forms, and other useful resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All students submitting an ETD will be able to choose either (1) &quot;open   access&quot; meaning the full-text of their work will be available in Emory&#039;s   repository immediately after graduation; or (2) &quot;restricted access;&quot; meaning   the publication of their work will be delayed for a specific period of time.   The current restricted access choices for authors are (i) six months, (ii)   one year, (iii) two years, or (iv) six years. The&lt;em&gt; access restriction period   expires automatically&lt;/em&gt; after the end of the access restriction period; it is   the responsibility of the author to request an extension of the access restriction   period if necessary. Such requests should be sent to:   &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:etd-help@listserv.cc.emory.edu&quot;&gt;etd-help@listserv.cc.emory.edu&lt;/a&gt;.   Even documents with a full-text restriction will have published and accessible ETD   records that include information about the dissertation or thesis, such as author,   title, committee, program, abstract and table of contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your abstract or table of contents includes sensitive   information, you have the option of also restricting access to those   components, meaning they will not be published in your ETD record   until your access restriction period expires. Follow the   instructions during the submission process in order to restrict   access to the abstract and/or table of contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ETD repository was created by the university to increase access to the   work of Emory Scholars. The University hopes that authors submitting their   work here who choose to restrict access to their work will choose the shortest   possible restriction period, taking into consideration the constraints of their   individual situations and the demands of their particular academic field. We   restate the Laney Graduate School&#039;s statement on access issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;border:3px double #666666;background-color:#CCCCCC;padding:15px&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Note on Access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to electronic theses and dissertation creates unparalleled opportunities   for wide and timely dissemination of the work of Emory graduates, creating   greater opportunities for your scholarly work to be recognized by others in   your field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also creates new parameters for copyright and publishing, and it is important   that you make an informed decision about the terms of access to your dissertation   or thesis. In particular, you need to learn about two issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your dissertation contains articles that were published in scholarly      journals or elsewhere, you need to make sure that your terms of access are      compatible with the permissions granted by those journals or other entities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you plan to publish some or all of your dissertation/thesis, you need      find out whether the journals and publishers who would be likely to publish      your work regard an electronically accessible dissertation as a prior publication.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policies on both these issues vary widely across fields and publishers,   and are changing fast. Take the time to investigate the conditions in your   field, and make your decisions with accurate and up-to-date information, and   in consultation with your advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Library offers regular information sessions on copyright and intellectual   property. You can find dates and times on the ETD website. Take advantage of   these sessions to learn about issues that will be important throughout your   scholarly career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. Forms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All authors must complete the appropriate ETD Submission Agreement Form. All other required forms are available via the Laney Graduate School, the Candler School of Theology, or the College Honors Program websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/content/etd/doc/Graduate_Submission_Form.doc&quot;&gt;Laney Graduate Submission Agreement Form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/webfm_send/406&quot; alt=&quot;application/msword&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/etd/doc/CST_Submission_Form.doc&quot;&gt;Candler School of Theology Submission Agreement Form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/webfm_send/406&quot; alt=&quot;application/msword&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/etd/doc/Honors_Submission_Form.doc&quot;&gt;College Honors Program Submission Form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/webfm_send/406&quot; alt=&quot;application/msword&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;3. Intellectual Property&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All theses and dissertations produced at Emory are the intellectual property   of the authors. Authors may disseminate those works as they see fit, but they   are also solely responsible for the contents of their thesis or dissertation.   Please refer to our    &lt;a href=&quot;https://etd.library.emory.edu/docs/ip&quot;&gt;Intellectual    Property page&lt;/a&gt; for helpful information on author&#039;s   rights and the use of previously copyrighted materials. All questions regarding   patentable content in a thesis or dissertation should be referred to the   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ott.emory.edu/&quot;&gt;Office of Technology Transfer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ott-web@emory.edu&quot;&gt;ott-web@emory.edu&lt;/a&gt;) and your   advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4. Patentable Material&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your thesis or dissertation discloses or describes any  inventions or discoveries that could potentially have commercial  application and therefore warrant patenting, then you need to consult  with both the Office of Technology Transfer and ETD administrators  &lt;em&gt;before submitting your thesis or dissertation&lt;/em&gt;.  You may  contact OTT (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:ott-web@emory.edu&quot;&gt;ott-web@emory.edu&lt;/a&gt;)  and ETD administrators using the online &lt;a href=&quot;https://etd.library.emory.edu/help&quot;&gt;ETD help form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;5. Paper Copies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library will no longer produce paper copies of theses and dissertations,     and will not hold a copy on its shelves. The electronic copy will be the     university&#039;s official copy of your work. Please contact your graduate program     for information on their requirements on paper copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See our information page on   &lt;a href=&quot;https://etd.library.emory.edu/docs/boundcopies&quot;&gt;Obtaining   Bound Copies of Your Theses and Dissertations&lt;/a&gt; for information on paper copies for your personal use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;6. ProQuest&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All doctoral dissertations will continue to be sent to ProQuest where they     will be made available under the terms set in their submission agreement.     (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://gs.emory.edu/resources/progress.php?id=7&quot;&gt;Laney Graduate School Website&lt;/a&gt; for necessary paper forms.) Master&#039;s theses     may be sent to ProQuest at the discretion of the author. Please be aware     that     most students should choose from one of the two &quot;traditional publishing&quot;     options for ProQuest. ProQuest offers two &quot;open access&quot; options     which give you an opportunity to place your work in their open access repository,     a     service offered without cost by Emory. (Students may choose to use the ProQuest     open access repository if they choose to do so, however, if they choose to     pay the additional fee.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProQuest does not offer an access restriction period of greater than 2 years.     If you choose Emory&#039;s six year option, it is your responsibility to see that     ProQuest is informed that you wish an embargo term of greater than two years.    Contact them directly at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:disspub@proquest.com&quot;&gt;disspub@proquest.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you elect to restrict access to your abstract, you will need to notify ProQuest directly soon after graduation in order to request they not include your abstract in Dissertations Abstract. In order to restrict access to your abstract, you must contact ProQuest/UMI directly, at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:disspub@proquest.com&quot;&gt;disspub@proquest.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Provide your name, the dissertation title, the school (Emory University), and, if possible, the publication number (not necessary but makes things easier).  If you need to speak with someone at ProQuest, the appropriate department can be reached at 734-761-4700, x7020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;II. Policies and Procedures for Undergraduate Students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program for Electronic Submission of Undergraduate Honors theses has completed its pilot stage and is now a mandatory component of the Honors Program. With the exception of the details for submitting to ProQuest, the ETD procedures and policy for Graduate Students apply for Undergraduate Students. An Undergraduate Student does not submit his or her thesis to ProQuest, so all policies around this feature do not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please consult the College Honors Program for the Program guidelines, instructions on preparing your thesis, access to necessary forms, and other useful resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;III. Policies and Procedures for Candler School of Theology Students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program for Electronic Submission of Candler masters theses is now in its pilot stage. With the exception of the details for submitting to ProQuest, the ETD procedures and policy for Graduate Students apply for Candler Students. A Candler Student does not submit his or her thesis to ProQuest, so all policies around this feature do not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please consult the Candler School of Theology guidelines for instructions on preparing your thesis, access to necessary forms, and other useful resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#protecting_copyright&quot;&gt;Protecting your copyright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;basics&quot;&gt;Copyright Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright is a federal law found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.gov/title17&quot;&gt;Title 17 of the United States Code&lt;/a&gt;, which gives authors the right to control the use of their work for a limited period of time. The law also grants exemptions to users of copyrighted works; one such exemption is Fair Use (link to fair use further down the page). In order to be copyrighted, a work must be &quot;an original work of authorship&quot; and &quot;fixed in a tangible medium of expression.&quot; To be &quot;original&quot; a work must have a minimal amount of creativity. A list of facts or names in a phone book is not sufficiently creative to be copyrightable. A work is &quot;fixed&quot; if it is sufficiently permanent or stable to allow it to be perceived, reproduced or otherwise communicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of what cannot be copyrighted include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Titles, names, short phrases, slogans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facts, news, and research&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Works created by the U.S. Government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright occurs automatically, and one does not need to register a work nor affix a copyright notice to the work in order for the work to be protected by copyright. Currently, the term of copyright is the life of the author plus 70 years. When the term of copyright expires, the work enters the public domain and can be used without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;prev_copyright&quot;&gt;Including Previously Copyrighted Materials in Your ETD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authors submitting to the ETD repository are subject to the same concerns regarding copyright as those using the traditional submission procedures. In order to include any previously copyrighted material, including text, images, figures, tables, or audio-visual materials, in an ETD, the material must either be unambiguously in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/training/Hirtle_Public_Domain.htm&quot;&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt; or fall within the parameters of &lt;a href=&quot;#fair_use&quot;&gt;fair use&lt;/a&gt;.  If the material does not fall within either of those categories, authors must receive permission from the copyright owner to include the material in their ETD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fair_use&quot;&gt;What is Fair Use?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair use is an exemption within copyright law that allows for the use of copyrighted materials without obtaining permission, provided the use is fair. A determination of fair use rests upon a four factor analysis, and the goal of the analysis is to balance the rights of the copyright owner with the rights of the public to use portions of copyrighted materials for education, commentary or criticism. The fair use exemption is technologically neutral, so the same four factor analysis should be applied regardless of the medium. For help in performing a fair use analysis, please use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/etd/doc/Fair_Use_Checklist.doc&quot;&gt;fair use checklist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/webfm_send/406&quot; alt=&quot;application/msword&quot; /&gt; and retain a copy of the completed checklist for your records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the only way to definitively determine whether a use is fair is to have it resolved in federal court, it is important to understand fair use and the four factor analysis used to determine whether a use is fair. If a copyright owner claims infringement, the court can reduce the amount of money damages if the alleged infringer can show an understanding of the fair use analysis and that they made a good faith determination that the use was fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 107 of Title 17 of the United States Code states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A,       the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by       reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means       specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism,       comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for       classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement       of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in       any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered       shall include--
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; the nature of the copyrighted work;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value     of the copyrighted work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Factor 1: Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the use refers to whether the use is for an educational purpose, such as teaching or research, or whether the purpose is for a commercial activity. Another consideration is whether the use is transformative, whether the use changes the original work to serve a new purpose. Educational uses and transformative uses weigh more favorably toward fair use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Factor 2: Nature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the copyrighted work refers to whether a work is artistic and creative or whether it is factual in nature. A factual work weighs more favorably toward fair use than an artistic and creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this factor takes into consideration whether the work in question has been published or is unpublished. An unpublished work weighs less favorably toward fair use, as one of the exclusive rights granted to copyright holders is the right to determine when their work is first published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Factor 3: Amount&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When determining the amount of the use one should perform both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. The smaller the portion used, the more likely the use would be considered a fair use. However, even a very small portion of a work may not be considered a fair use if it were the &quot;heart of the work,&quot; or the most memorable aspect of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Factor 4: Effect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth factor considers whether, if the use of a work were widespread, it would deprive the copyright owner of income or negatively impact the market or potential market for the original work. Consequently, the more restricted the use, the less of an impact there will likely be on the market or potential market for the original work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth factor is also linked to the purpose of the use because a negative impact on the market is often presumed if a use is for a commercial purpose. However, if the use is for an educational purpose or is transformative, then a negative impact on the market will be more difficult to prove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;permission&quot;&gt;Permission Process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your use of a previously copyrighted work exceeds fair use, you need permission from the copyright owner. When writing a permission letter, you should include a thorough description of the material to be used and how you plan to use it.(See a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/etd/doc/Permissions_Letter_Text.doc&quot;&gt;sample permission letter for text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/webfm_send/406&quot; alt=&quot;application/msword&quot; /&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/etd/doc/Permissions_Letter_Images.doc&quot;&gt;sample permission letter for images&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://digital.library.emory.edu/webfm_send/406&quot; alt=&quot;application/msword&quot; /&gt;.)   Permission should be sought in writing, which can be via e-mail, and all documentation should be kept. Should any question arise, you will be able to prove you received permission to use the material if you have kept a record of your correspondence. You must receive an affirmative response from the copyright owner before using the material. If you do not receive a response from the copyright owner, consider revising your use of the material to fall within fair use or using an alternative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are organizations that manage permissions for authors. By contacting one of these collective rights organizations you may be able to receive the permission you need without having to contact an individual copyright owner. One such organization is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.com&quot;&gt;Copyright Clearance Center (CCC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;prev_pub&quot;&gt;Including a Previously Published Journal   Article as a Chapter in Your ETD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have previously published an article, either as an author or co-author, and would like to include it in your ETD, you need to consider whether the particular chapter is not substantially different from the published article and if the publication agreement allows subsequent publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the chapter is not substantially different and the publication       agreement does not allow subsequent publication, you can either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;request permission from the publisher, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;link to the article if it is available online&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permission is only needed if the particular chapter in your ETD is not substantially different from the previously published article. The particular chapter in your thesis or dissertation may be substantially different because articles are often shorter and more concise, while your thesis or dissertation may include all your data and a more thorough explanation of your research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permission is also not needed if the publication agreement includes provisions for the author to retain the right reproduce the article for non-commercial purposes or post the article to institutional websites or open-access repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;rights&quot;&gt;Retaining Rights to your Publications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many publishers use traditional publication agreements which require that all rights, including copyright, transfer to the journal publisher. Consequently, if you have transferred your copyright to the journal, you may have to ask for permission from the journal publisher to include your article in your ETD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to avoid this issue is to carefully read all your publication agreements and negotiate with the publisher. If your research has been accepted for publication in a journal, book, or conference proceeding, you can negotiate with the publisher to retain some of your rights. If you would like to include the material in an ETD or to reuse the material is some other way, negotiate with the publisher to create such an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to retain some of your rights, including the right to include your article in your ETD, is to add the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.html&quot;&gt;SPARC Author Addendum&lt;/a&gt; to your publication agreement. The addendum modifies the publication agreement to allow the author to retain some rights, including the ability to reproduce the article for non-commercial purposes, prepare derivative works from the article, and post the article to personal or institutional websites or open-access digital repositories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;author_concerns&quot;&gt;Publication Concerns for Authors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emory authors retain the copyright to their theses and dissertations. In submitting one&#039;s thesis or dissertation to the repository, you grant to the University a limited publication license. Emory may retain a copy for preservation purposes and publish the document via the World Wide Web by including it in our repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many authors, especially in the humanities, produce books from their dissertations. Some publishers may have concerns about a thesis or dissertation, on which a book is to be based, having been previously available on the web. We recommend, therefore, that you check with your publisher about whether depositing your document in the repository would jeopardize your publication plans in the future. Because most books produced from dissertations require considerable revision, there is a strong argument that depositing a thesis or dissertation in the repository would not amount to a prior publication.  Also, availability of a thesis or dissertation on the web can increase interest in a topic be an indicator of potential book sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;protecting_copyright&quot;&gt;Protecting your copyright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright is automatically granted to the author of a work at the time the work is created in a fixed form. Neither a notice of copyright, nor registration is required by law.  However, it is beneficial to include a copyright notice on your thesis or dissertation because it shows your reader that you are the copyright owner and states the first date of publication. An example of such a notice is: © &lt;em&gt;2007 Jane Doe&lt;/em&gt;. The notice should be placed in a prominent location, typically after the title page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while registration is not required for copyright protection, you will receive certain benefits by registering your copyright with the Copyright Office. Registration establishes a public record of your copyright and is necessary before you can file a lawsuit for copyright infringement. By registering your copyright before an infringement occurs, you will be eligible to receive statutory damages and attorney&#039;s fees. An added benefit of registering your copyright is the inclusion of your dissertation or thesis in the Library of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you publish your dissertation through UMI, UMI can prepare the registration forms and deposit copies of your thesis or dissertation on your behalf. You may also download the forms from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copyright.gov&quot;&gt;U.S. Copyright Office website&lt;/a&gt; and submit the forms and copies of your thesis or dissertation yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
    <link>https://digital.library.emory.edu/content/etd/faq</link>
    <description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;general&quot;&gt;General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why do we want and need an ETD repository?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of the ETD repository is to provide convenient access to one of the most important intellectual products of the university - masters theses, doctoral dissertations, and undergraduate honors theses. In the past, access to an Emory thesis or dissertation was quite limited. Beyond reading the one copy held in Emory&#039;s library, interested (non-Emory) researchers could only acquire copies of theses and dissertations through interlibrary loan or by purchasing a paper or electronic copy of the document from UMI. Moreover, it often took a number of months after the author&#039;s graduation before the academic community could access the document. The ETD repository offers prompt web-based access to these documents, greatly increasing the visibility of our scholars and fulfilling our core mission: to contribute to academic scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Will this new process be time consuming and complicated?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. One of the primary goals of this project is to streamline the submission process. Although the introduction of the ETD system will require the creation and submission of an electronic document, we anticipate that most users will be able to complete the ETD submission process in less than 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Does this mean Emory will no longer keep paper copies of dissertations?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, eventually. Emory&#039;s Library is attempting to control the growth of its ever-growing physical collections. Replacing the library&#039;s bound paper copies of theses and dissertations with an electronic copy will create significant space savings, while actually increasing accessibility. The library will not deposit a copy of your dissertation in the library stacks if you have created an ETD. With the university-wide rollout of the ETD program in the fall of 2008, all Emory theses and dissertations produced by Emory College, Candler School of Theology, and the Laney Graduate School are available only in their electronic form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;submission&quot;&gt;Submission/Administrative Issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Will this new process create new deadlines?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Your ETD will be due according to the deadline set by your school or program. (If you are unable to meet a deadline, you must get permission from your school or program to submit your work late.) Students should submit their document to the ETD system prior to delivering paper forms and, for the Graduate School, a paper copy of the PDF to the appropriate administrative contact in your school or program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does my committee approve my thesis or dissertation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be no change in this regard. Your committee will continue to sign a paper document which you will need to turn into the appropriate administrative contact in yourschool or program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Will we submit our work to UMI/ProQuest?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Students graduating from the Laney Graduate School will continue submitting work to Proquest. Your document will be microfilmed, indexed in Dissertations Abstracts, and, if you choose the ProQuest&#039;s traditional submission method, a PDF of your document will be made available through ProQuest, and will be available to the public for a fee. (ProQuest dissertations by Emory authors are available via a free download to Emory students and faculty.) As an alternative to the traditional submission method, ProQuest is creating its own open access dissertation repository, and for a fee you may deposit your dissertation there. We expect most students interested in open access to bypass this paid ProQuest service, since Emory will provide an identical service for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you elect to restrict access to your abstract, you will need to notify ProQuest/UMI soon after graduation in order to request they not include your abstract in Dissertations Abstract. In order to restrict access to your abstract, you must contact ProQuest/UMI directly, at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:disspub@proquest.com&quot;&gt;disspub@proquest.com&lt;/a&gt;. Provide your name, the dissertation title, the school (Emory University), and, if possible, the publication number (not necessary but makes things easier). If you need to speak with someone at ProQuest/UMI, the appropriate department can be reached at 734-761-4700, x7020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>About Us</title>
    <link>https://digital.library.emory.edu/content/etd/about</link>
    <description>&lt;h2&gt;Program Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step towards creating an institutional repository, Emory began plans for its ETD repository in the Spring of 2006 when the library&#039;s Digital Programs and Systems division formed the ETD Advisory Group, comprised of faculty, graduate students, university administrators and librarians.  A fulltime project manager was hired in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of the ETD repository is to provide convenient access to one of the most important intellectual products of the university - masters theses and doctoral dissertations.  (It will also recognize the contributions of undergraduate scholars by collecting undergraduate honors theses.)  In the past, access to an Emory thesis or dissertation was quite limited.  Beyond reading the one copy held in Emory&#039;s library, interested (non-Emory) researchers could only acquire copies of theses and dissertations through interlibrary loan or by purchasing a paper or electronic copy of the document from UMI/Proquest.  Moreover, it often took a number of months after the author&#039;s graduation before the academic community could access the document.  The ETD repository offers prompt web-based access to these documents, greatly increasing the visibility of our scholars and fulfilling our core mission: to contribute to academic scholarship. It is our hope that this program will also streamline the submission process and eliminate the production of unnecessary paper copies of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program was overseen by the university&#039;s ETD advisory group: University Library Representatives: Martin Halbert, Erika Farr, Katherine Skinner, Lars Meyer, Ginger Cain and Paul O&#039;Grady; Faculty Representatives: Simon Blakey, Department of Chemistry, Kathy Miner, Rollins School of Public Health, Paul Courtright, Department of Religion, Harry Rusche, Department of English, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, Department of History, Walt Reed, Institute for Liberal Arts; Rick Rubinson, Deptment of Sociology (and formerly of the Graduate School); Staff Representatives: Maureen Sweatman, Office for Undergraduate Education, Monica Taylor, Graduate Division of Biological/Biomedical Sciences, Queen Watson, Emory Graduate School; Student Representatives: Wesley Robertson, Department of Physics, Scott Gavorsky, Department of History.  The contributions of the Emory Graduate School administration, including Dean Lisa Tedesco, Rosemary Hynes, and Virginia Shadron were invaluable to the design of this program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Software Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submission system used is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fedora-commons.org/&quot;&gt;Fedora Digital Repository System&lt;/a&gt; combined with a custom Fedora front-end interface developed at the Emory  University Libraries based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://framework.zend.com/&quot;&gt;Zend Framework&lt;/a&gt; and utilizing XForms.   The software development team at Emory is led by Kyle Fenton and includes Rebecca Sutton Koeser, Jason White, Chris Roddy, and Smita Patel.&lt;/p&gt;
