<b>Part 1: Synthesis and Anti-HIV Activity of Novel <br>Cyclobutyl Nucleoside and Nucleotide Analogs <br> <br>1.1     Statement of purpose <br> </b><br>
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has become one of the <br>
major causes of death in the world. It is estimated that over 40 million people are <br>
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is the causative <br>
agent of AIDS.1 In 1985, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) was approved as the <br>
first synthetic nucleoside to inhibit the replication of HIV. Since then, a number of <br>
other synthetic nucleoside analogs have been proven to be effective against HIV. <br>
After phosphorylation to the triphosphate form by cellular kinases, the <br>
nucleotides are incorporated into a growing strand of viral DNA and cause chain <br>
termination due to the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl group.  <br>
Despite the enormous success of nucleoside based therapy of HIV <br>
infection, there is still no cure for AIDS.  One reason is that the prolonged clinical <br>
use of nucleoside analogs gives rise to resistant viruses that contain mutations in <br>
the reverse transcriptase (RT).2 For example, the M184V/I mutation in HIV-1 RT <br>
is associated with high level resistance to lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine <br>
(FTC). Structural studies suggest that the mechanism of resistance of HIV-1 RT <br>
carrying the M184V/I mutation involves steric hindrance, which would prevent <br>
further incorporation of nucleoside analogs such as 3TC and FTC in the <br>
nucleotide forms.3  <br>
 We postulated that the more rigid and smaller cyclobutyl ring would <br>
enable the nucleoside analog to fit into the more sterically hindered active site of <br>
